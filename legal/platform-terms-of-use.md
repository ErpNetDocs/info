This may include submitting Order Forms or enabling Third-party Application, creating, de-provisioning, monitoring or modifying User Accounts, and setting User usage permissions; and managing access to Data by Users or others. Without limiting Section 5.3 (Responsibility for Users), you are responsible for whom you allow to become Administrators and any actions they take, including as described above. You agree that ERP.net responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Cloud Services for you.

The appointment of an Administrator does not in any way limit the liability of the Customer. In case of violation of this Agreement, the Administrator/s and the Customer are jointly and severally liable.

### 5.2. Resellers

For buying and upgrading the Services, as also bug fixes and support, the Customer may either work with an ERP.net Resellers as the main point of contact, or work with ERP.net directly.

#### 5.2.4. Resellers as Administrators

If Customer order Cloud Services through a Reseller, then the Customer is responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in the applicable agreement with the Reseller.  As between Customer and ERP.net, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other User Accounts.

### 5.3. Responsibility for Users

Some Cloud Services require Users to be designated by Administrators and some may allow Users to invite other Users. The appointed Administrator is responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Service you use and for controlling whom you allow to become a User.

Some Cloud Services may allow you to designate different types of Users, in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of User. You are responsible for compliance with this Agreement by all Users, including for any payment obligations. You are responsible for the activities of all Users, including Order Forms they may place and how Users use Your Data, even if those Users are not from your organization or domain.

If in any calendar month this uptime commitment is not met by ERP.net and Customer was negatively impacted (i.e., attempted to log into or access the Service and failed due to the unscheduled downtime of the Service), ERP.net shall provide, as the sole and exclusive remedy, a credit note equal to 50% of a monthly fee for the use of the Service.

#### 6.1.2. Scheduled and Unscheduled Maintenance

Customer with private servers have the option to postpone the update. The updates can be postponed only once and for maximum 1 (one) month. Customer should open a support ticket, based on the procedure in Section 6.2., indicating the period for which the update should be postponed.

Non-updated servers pose security and maintenance risks, therefore ERP.net cannot guarantee the normal operation or full functionality of the system during this time. ERP.net will not be responsible, during this period, for any data leaks, security problems, system malfunction or difficulties accessing the Cloud Services.

#### 6.1.4. Credit note request

In order to receive a credit note under this service level commitment, Customer must request it simply by emailing ERP.net billing e-mail,  no later than five days after the end of the applicable month.

The issued credit note is automatically deducted from the next monthly invoice. ERP.net shall calculate any service level downtime using ERP.net’s system logs and other records.

#### 6.1.5. Refusal of credit

ERP.net reserves the right to refuse to issue a credit note in case any of the following conditions are not met:

- Customer should not have breached any of the contractual obligation before or after the system unavailability.

### 6.2. Support

#### 6.2.1. Bugs and problems

For the duration of this Agreement, ERP.net commits to making all reasonable efforts to remedy any Bug of the Cloud Services submitted by the Customer through the appropriate channel (typically, the web form or phone numbers listed on the Help page, or when working with a Reseller, the channel provided by them), and to start handling such Customer submissions within 2 business days.

The period of 2 business days starts from the moment when a complete and detailed report about the Bug/s is provided, which should have a minimum information about: (a) what functionality was used, (b) what was the intended result, (c) what are the steps that were taken before the problem occurred, (d) what was the status of the user who tried to perform the action.

As soon as the Bug is fixed an appropriate remedy will be communicated to the Customer. Both parties acknowledge that as specified in the license of the Cloud Services and in Section 12 of this Agreement, ERP.net cannot be held liable for Bugs in the Cloud Services.

#### 6.2.2. Scope

For the duration of this Agreement, the Customer may open up to 10 (ten) support tickets per month for each instance of Cloud Platform they have, free of charge. The support tickets should cover questions regarding Bugs or Performance and Connectivity issues.

Other assistance requests, such as questions related to development or customizations may be covered through the purchase of a separate Support services Agreement. In case it’s not clear, if a request is covered by this Agreement, the decision is at the discretion of ERP.net.

#### 6.2.3. Availability

Tickets can be submitted via the web form or phone numbers listed on Help page. If a Customer is working with a Reseller, they can also send tickets through the channel provided by the Reseller, subject to their working hours.

### 6.3. Third-Party developers

#### 6.3.1. Third-party’s products and services

ERP.net or Third-party may make available (for example, through the Marketplace or otherwise) Third-party products or services, including, for example, Third-party Applications and implementation and other Consulting services. Any acquisition by Customer of such products or services, and any exchange of data between Customer and any Third-party’s product or service is solely between Customer and the applicable Third-party. ERP.net does not warrant or support Third-party Applications or other Third-party products or services, whether or not they are designated by ERP.net as “certified” or otherwise, unless expressly provided otherwise in an Order Form. ERP.net is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data resulting from access by such Third-party Application or its provider.

#### 6.3.2. Integration with Third-party Applications

The Services may contain features designed to interoperate with Third-party Applications. ERP.net cannot guarantee the continued availability of such Service features and may cease providing them without entitling Customer to any refund, credit, or other compensation, if for example and without limitation, the provider of a Third-party Application ceases to make the Third-party Application available for interoperation with the corresponding Service features in a manner acceptable to ERP.net.

#### 6.3.3. Removal of Content and Third-party Applications

If Customer receives notice that Third-party Application must be removed, modified and/or disabled to avoid violating applicable law, third-party rights, Customer will promptly do so. If Customer does not take required action in accordance with the above, or if in ERP.net’s judgment continued violation is likely to reoccur, ERP.net may disable the applicable Service and/or Third-party Application. If requested by ERP.net, Customer shall confirm such deletion and discontinuance of use in writing and ERP.net shall be authorized to provide a copy of such confirmation to any such third-party claimant or governmental authority, as applicable. In addition, if ERP.net is required by any third-party rights holder to remove content or receives information that content provided to Customer may violate applicable law or third-party rights, ERP.net may discontinue Customer’s access to content through the Services.

#### 6.3.4. Marketplace apps and tools

ERP.net offers applications developed by them or by third-parties through its official Marketplace, which are certified and have met the minimum requirements for working with Cloud services and software. However, each Customer has the right to use applications in conjunction with Cloud services that are not downloaded from the Marketplace, and Customer guarantees that they and their work with them will not violate the rules of this Agreement.

ERP.net certifies the various applications so that the Customer can choose safe and reliable applications for their work process. ERP.net ensures that the applications uploaded to the Marketplace (class A) meet the minimum requirements for security and reliability, and that they do not collect unnecessary information about the Customer. All applications that are not in class A are uncertified and ERP.net does not give any guarantees or warranties if the Customer chooses to integrate such applications in its work.

## 7. Use and restriction of the platform

### 7.1. Usage Limits

Services are subject to usage limits specified in Order Forms and Documentation. If Customer exceeds a contractual usage limit, ERP.net may work with Customer to seek to reduce Customer’s usage so that it conforms to that limit. If, notwithstanding ERP.net’s efforts, Customer is unable or unwilling to abide by a contractual usage limit, Customer will execute an Order Form for additional quantities of the applicable Services promptly upon ERP.net’s request, and/or pay any invoice for excess usage in accordance with the “Invoicing and Payment” section below.

The use of one User account by several different Users is expressly prohibited and will be considered a gross violation of this Agreement, which may result in termination of all Services without notice. This limit doesn’t apply for Business Partners accounts. If a Business Partner should access the system, a request for this is submitted through the platform and a Business Partner account of the given legal entity is created, which can be accessed by several Users.

Additionally, the ERP.net may, at its discretion, provide Free services under section 4.1.5. to Customer who they consider that is classified for them according to the internal ERP.net rules (universities, non-governmental organizations, churches). In such cases, the usage is limited to the resources that the ERP.net has decided to provide free of charge and according to the constraints it deems appropriate for the need of the Customer, stated in the Order Form.

#### 7.1.1. Different type of usage limits

- **Session Based** – this is a type of limitation that entitles the Customer to use the Cloud Service by User sessions, regardless of who the individual User is. In this case the number of licenses is equal to the number of User sessions, which can be performed simultaneously by Users of the Customer, which means there are no restriction on the number of registered Users.

- **User Based** – this is a type of limitation that entitles 1 /one/ individual User, identified in an Order Form, or in another appropriate way, to use the Cloud Services. In this case, the number of licenses is equal to the number of individual Users who can use the Cloud Services, which means there are restriction on the number of registered Users.

- **Resource Based** – this is a type of limitation that gives the Customer the right to use a certain capacity of the Cloud Services – until a certain load of resources or monthly quota is reached.

- **Purpose Based** – this is a type of limitation that limits the number of records in one instance of the Cloud Services to a certain number or a type (e.g., number of invoices for a month, number of cars, specific type of records etc.).

- **Functionality Based** – defines the functional modules or specific functions of the Cloud Services, which are subject to the license.

Multiple usage limits may be applied to Customer, based on their Order Form and personal and business needs.

### 7.2. Bundles

Customer or Developer, who has developed an application that integrates and requires a license for the ERP.net Cloud Platform, is not allowed to purchase licenses or act as an intermediary or reseller of such in order to sell them in a Bundle.

In case a Customer or a Developer wants to make their application available to other Customers and Users, they can sell it without a license for the ERP.net Cloud Platform through the official Marketplace or through their own channels.

If a Customer or a Developer wants to offer licenses for the ERP.net Cloud Platform, they can sign a Partnership agreement and be included in the official ERP.net reseller lists. If a Customer or a Developer wants, independently of the ERP.net, to develop apps, and offer them in Bundles with ERP.net Cloud Platform licenses, they should sign a separate Developer agreement.

### 7.3. Reservation of Rights

Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder, ERP.net, its Affiliates and its licensors reserve all of their right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all of their related intellectual property rights.  No rights are granted to Customer hereunder other than as expressly set forth herein.

### 7.4. Ownership of Customer Data

As between ERP.net and Customer, all title and intellectual property rights in and to the Customer Data is owned exclusively by Customer. Customer acknowledges and agrees that in connection with the provision of the Services, ERP.net may store and maintain Customer Data for a period of time consistent with ERP.net’s standard business processes for the Services. Following expiration or termination of the Agreement or a Customer account, if applicable, ERP.net may deactivate the applicable Customer and User account(s) and delete any data therein. Customer grants ERP.net the right to host, use, process, display and transmit Customer Data to provide the Services pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Order Form. Customer has sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of Customer Data, and for obtaining all rights related to Customer Data required by ERP.net to perform the Services.

### 7.5. ERP.net Intellectual Property Rights

All rights, title and interest in and to the Services (including without limitation all intellectual property rights therein and all modifications, extensions, customizations, scripts or other derivative works of the Services provided or developed by ERP.net) and anything developed or delivered by or on behalf of ERP.net under this Agreement are owned exclusively by ERP.net or its licensors. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights granted to Customer do not convey any rights in the Services, express or implied, or ownership in the Services or any intellectual property rights thereto. Any rights in the Services or ERP.net’s intellectual property not expressly granted herein by ERP.net are reserved by ERP.net.

### 7.6. Suggestions/Feedback

Customer grants ERP.net and its Affiliates a royalty free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable right to use, modify, distribute and incorporate into the Services (without attribution of any kind) any suggestions, enhancement request, recommendations, proposals, correction or other feedback or information provided by Customer or any Users related to the operation or functionality of the Services or its Affiliates’ services.

### 7.7. Trademark

Except where noticed otherwise in writing, each party grants the other a non-transferable, non-exclusive, royalty free, worldwide license to reproduce and display the other party’s name, logos and trademarks, solely for the purpose of referring to the other party as a customer or supplier, on websites, press releases and other marketing materials.

## 8. Privacy and Information

### 8.1. Confidentiality

#### 8.1.1. Definition of Confidential Information

- **“Confidential Information”** means all information disclosed by a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information of Customer includes Customer Data; Confidential Information of ERP.net includes the Services and the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Order Forms (including pricing). Confidential Information of each party includes business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by such party.

#### 8.1.2. Exceptions

Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the non-disclosure obligations set forth in this “Confidentiality” section apply to Confidential Information exchanged between the parties in connection with the evaluation of additional ERP.net services.

#### 8.1.3. Protection of Confidential Information

As between the parties, each party retains all ownership rights in and to its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care).

Each party agrees not to disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to any third party other than as set forth in the following sentence for a period of five years from the date of the disclosing party’s disclosure of the Confidential Information to the receiving party; however, ERP.net will protect the confidentiality of Customer Data residing in the Cloud Service for as long as such information resides in the Cloud Service. Each party may disclose Confidential Information only to those employees, agents or subcontractors who are required to protect it against unauthorized disclosure in a manner no less protective than required under this Agreement, and each party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information in any legal proceeding or to a governmental entity as required by law. ERP.net will protect the confidentiality of Customer Data residing in the Services in accordance with the ERP.net security practices applicable to Customer’s Order Form as described in this Agreement or such Order Form.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, ERP.net may disclose the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Order Form to a subcontractor or Third-party Developer to the extent necessary to perform ERP.net’s obligations under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective as set forth herein.

#### 8.1.4. Compelled Disclosure

The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.

#### 8.1.5. Publicity

Neither party will use the name of the other party in publicity activities without the prior written consent of the other, except that Customer agrees that ERP.net may use Customer's name in customer listings or quarterly calls with its investors or, at times mutually agreeable to the parties, as part of ERP.net's marketing efforts (including reference calls and stories, press testimonials, site visits). Customer agrees that ERP.net may share information on Customer with its Affiliates for marketing and other business purposes and that it has secured appropriate authorizations to share Customer employee contact information with ERP.net.

#### 8.1.6. Return of Information

Upon written request, Customer will promptly return or destroy (and certify such destruction in writing) all Confidential Information in its possession.

### 8.2. Data protection

#### 8.2.1. Protection of Customer Data

ERP.net will maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Customer Data, as described in the Documentation. Those safeguards will include, but will not be limited to, measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of Customer Data (other than by Customer or Users). Except with respect to a free trial, the terms of the data processing addendum at Privacy and DPA page are hereby incorporated by reference and shall apply to the extent Customer Data includes Personal Data, as defined in the DPA. To the extent Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom and Switzerland are processed by us, ERP.net will not transfer personal data outside of EU, except in cases where that was explicitly demanded by the Customer or where it’s strictly necessary for the performance of the Service. In case of a data transfer outside of EEA in case there’s no Adequacy decision under art. 45 GDPR for this country/territory, the Customer agrees to a Standard Contractual Clauses, where Customer and its applicable Affiliates are each the data exporter, and Customer's acceptance of this Agreement, and an applicable Affiliate's execution of an Order Form, shall be treated as its execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses and Appendices.

#### 8.2.2. Processing of Personal Data

The parties acknowledge that the Customer’s database may contain Personal Data, for which the Customer is the Controller. This data will be processed by ERP.net the Customer instructs so, or if the Customer transfers their database or a part of their database to ERP.net for any reason pertaining to this Agreement.

This processing will be performed in conformance with Data Protection Legislation. In particular, ERP.net commits to:

- only process the Personal Data when and as instructed by the Customer, and for the purpose of performing one of the Services under this Agreement, unless required by law to do so, in which case ERP.net will provide prior notice to the Customer, unless the law forbids it;
- ensure that all persons within ERP.net authorised to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality;
- implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, theft, alteration or disclosure;
- forward promptly to the Customer any Data Protection request that was submitted to ERP.net with regard to the Customer’s database;
- notify the Customer promptly upon becoming aware of and confirming any accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful processing of, disclosure of, or access to the Personal Data;
- notify the Customer if the processing instructions infringe applicable Data Protection Legislation, in the opinion of ERP.net;
- make available to the Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the Data Protection Legislation, allow for and contribute reasonably to audits, including inspections, conducted or mandated by the Customer;

Customer agrees to provide ERP.net with accurate contact information at all times, as necessary to notify the Customer’s Data Protection responsible.

#### 8.2.3. Subprocessors

The Customer acknowledges and agrees that in order to provide the Services, ERP.net may use third-party service providers (Subprocessors) to process Personal Data. ERP.net commits to only use Subprocessors in compliance with Data Protection Legislation. This use will be covered by a contract between ERP.net and the Subprocessor that provides guarantees to that effect.

#### 8.2.4. Transmission of Data

Customer understands that the technical processing and transmission of Customer’s Electronic Communications is fundamentally necessary to use of the Cloud Service.  Customer is responsible for cable or another Internet connection and up to date “browser” software in order to utilize the Cloud Service.  Customer expressly consents to ERP.net’s interception and storage of Electronic Communications and/or Customer Data as needed to provide the Services hereunder, and Customer acknowledges and understands that Customer’s Electronic Communications will involve transmission over the Internet, and over various networks, only part of which may be owned and/or operated by ERP.net.  Customer further acknowledges and understands that Electronic Communications may be accessed by unauthorized parties when communicated across the Internet, network communications facilities, telephone or other electronic means.  Without limiting ERP.net’s applicable obligations under this Agreement, ERP.net is not responsible for any Electronic Communications and/or Customer Data which are delayed, lost, altered, intercepted or stored during the transmission of any data whatsoever across networks not owned and/or operated by ERP.net, including, but not limited to, the Internet and Customer’s local network.

#### 8.2.5. Access to Customer Data

Upon request by Customer made within 30 days after the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, ERP.net will make Customer Data available to Customer for export or download as provided in the Documentation. After such 30-day period, ERP.net will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Data, and as provided in the Documentation will thereafter delete or destroy all copies of Customer Data in its systems or otherwise in its possession or control, unless legally prohibited.

For the duration of the Agreement, Customer can access its Customer Data at any time. Customer may export and retrieve its Customer Data in a standard format. Export and retrieval may be subject to technical limitations, in which case ERP.net and Customer will find a reasonable method to allow Customer access to Customer Data. Before the Agreement Term expires, Customer may use ERP.net’s API (Application Programming Interface) endpoint to perform a final export of Customer Data from the Cloud Service.

In the event of third-party legal proceedings relating to the Customer Data, ERP.net will cooperate with Customer and comply with applicable law (both at Customer’s expense) with respect to handling of the Customer Data.

## 9. Invoices and Payment

### 9.1. Billing Models

Billing Models are different approaches for pricing and charging a Customer based on their needs, use of the Services, and purchased licenses. ERP.net offers three types of Billing Models for their Customers. Billing Models are applied to the different Usage limits (see Section 7.1.1). Depending on the details specified in the Order Form one Billing Model can be applied to all Usage limits or different Billing Models can be chosen for specific Usage limits.

#### 9.1.1. Types of Billing Models

- **Subscription Billing Model** – You commit in advance to purchase a specific quantity of Services and to pay upfront for each Billing Period as stated on the Order Form. Committed quantities not used during the month will expire at the end of it.

- **Usage Billing Models** (Pay-As-You-Go) – You pay based on actual usage in the preceding month with no upfront commitment. Payment is on a periodic basis, according to the Billing Period specified in the Order Form.

- **Combined billing model** (Pay-As-You-Grow) – This model combines the above two and it’s applied exceptionally to certain usage limits. Customer commits to specific quantity, which is paid upfront for every Billing Period (Subscription Model). In case the Customer's needs exceed this quantity, they are charged based on certain unit of cost (Usage Model). In the beginning of each Billing Period Customer is billed for all excess usage from the last Billing Period, plus the applicable subscription fee for the next.

#### 9.1.2. Pre-set restrictions

With respect to ERP.net Cloud Services, when Customer has chosen the Subscription Billing Model for a specific Usage limit, all additional or other usage (for example, usage beyond Customer’s commitment quantity) may be transformed to a Combined Billing Model for that particular Billing Period. ERP.net will try to notify Customer and the Administrator before such transformation occurs.

#### 9.1.3. Default Billing Model

Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Order Form or Documentation, the Subscription Billing Model should apply to the Purchased Services and their Usage limits for the duration of the Agreement.

Customer can make a request for different combinations of Usage limits and Billing Models, but ERP.net reserves the right to prepare a personal offer that may better meet the needs of the Customer.

### 9.2. Agreement Term

This Agreement commences on the date on which an Order Form is submitted by the Customer and shall continue in effect for an indefinite period of time until it is terminated in accordance with the provisions thereof. This Agreement is valid for the Order Forms which this Agreement accompanies.

### 9.3. Pricing and Payment

Customer will provide ERP.net with valid and updated bank card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to ERP.net. If Customer provides bank card (credit card, debit card, virtual card etc.) information to ERP.net, Customer authorizes ERP.net to charge such bank card for all Purchased Services listed in the Order Form for the duration of this Agreement.

Such charges shall be made either monthly or in accordance with any different Billing Period stated in Order Form. Depending on the Billing Models chosen, such charges will be made:

- In case of **Subscription Billing Model** – on the 1st of the month for the advance use for next Billing Period;
- In case of **Usage Billing Models** – on the 1st of the month for the use generated in the previous Billing Period;
- In case of **Combined billing model** – on the 1st of the month for the advance and used quantities;

Regardless of the start date of the Agreement, the Customer’s card shall be charged or the Customer shall be invoiced on the 1st day of the month. All Services used prior to that day shall be included in the first charge or invoice, together with the Fees for the next month. If the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method other than a bank card, ERP.net will invoice Customer in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, invoiced fees are due net 15 days from the invoice date. Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to ERP.net and notifying ERP.net of any changes to such information.

Customer agrees that its purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by ERP.net regarding future functionality or features.

### 9.4. Renewal

Except as otherwise specified in an Order Form, the Agreement Term will automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Agreement Term or one year (whichever is shorter), unless either party gives the other written notice (email acceptable) at least 30 days before the end of the relevant Agreement Term. Except as expressly provided in the applicable Order Form, renewal of promotional or one-time prices will be at ERP.net’s applicable list price in effect at the time of the applicable renewal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any renewal in which Purchased Services volume or Agreement Term length for any Services has decreased from the prior term will result in re-pricing at renewal without regard to the prior term’s per-unit pricing.

If there is no Contract End Date specified in the applicable Order Form, the Agreement shall renew automatically on the 1st of every month.

### 9.5. Price Changes

#### 9.5.1. Change in Pricing Lists
ERP.net may unilaterally change its pricing lists at any time. In such case, the prices under this Agreement shall change accordingly from the next Billing Period, provided that ERP.net has notified the Customer of such changes and the Agreement has remained in force.

#### 9.5.2. Expiry of promotional prices
Except as expressly provided in the applicable Order Form, promotional or one-time prices will revert back to ERP.net’s standard list prices at the start of the next Billing Period.

#### 9.5.3. Change in Purchased Services
The Customer may request an increase or decrease in the Purchased Services at any time by placing a new Order Form. In such case, the change in Services shall take effect from the start date of the new Order Form. If the Customer has removed or decreased any pre-paid Services, ERP.net shall retain the applicable pre-paid fees. If the Customer has increased his pre-paid Services, the price increase for the remainder of the then-current Billing Period will be added to the Customer’s invoice or bank charge for the next Billing Period. If the Services were not pre-paid, they will be charged accordingly at the end of the applicable Billing Period.

#### 9.5.4. Clerical errors
ERP.net reserves the right to make any corrections to prices quoted due to clerical errors or errors of omission.

### 9.6. No Refunds

All amounts are non-refundable, non-cancellable and non-creditable. You agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable.

### 9.7. Overdue Charges

If any invoiced amount is not received by ERP.net by the due date, then without limiting ERP.net’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) ERP.net may condition future renewals and Order Forms on payment terms, shorter than those specified in this section.

### 9.8. Suspension of Service and Acceleration

If any charge owing by Customer under this or any other Agreement for Services is 30 days or more overdue, (or 10 or more days overdue in the case of amounts Customer has authorized ERP.net to charge to Customer’s bank card), ERP.net may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee obligations under such Agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until such amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for Customers paying by credit card or direct debit whose payment has been declined, ERP.net will give Customer at least 10 days prior notice that its account is overdue before suspending services to Customer.

#### 9.8.1. Payment Disputes

ERP.net will not exercise its rights in the sections above if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.

### 9.9. Fees

Customer will pay all Fees specified in Order Forms. Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, (i) Fees are based on Purchased Services and the chosen Billing Models, and (ii) payment obligations are non-cancellable and Fees paid are non-refundable.

Customer will pay the Fees applicable to the Purchased Services and the Billing Models (“License Fees”) and any other Fees, including but not limited to Fees relating to currency conversion, bank charges, transfer charges and any related payment transaction charges (“Transaction Fees”), and any Fees relating to your purchase or use of any services such as App, Marketplace purchases, or Third-Party Services (“Additional Fees”).

License Fees are paid based on the applicable Billing Models and will be billed in as stated in Section 9.3 – Pricing and Payment. Transaction Fees and Additional Fees will be charged from time to time at ERP.net’s discretion. You will be charged at the beginning of each Billing Period for all outstanding Fees that have not previously been charged. Fees will appear on an invoice, which will be sent to the Customer and Administrator.

### 9.10. Resellers

If you make any purchases through an authorized partner or reseller of ERP.net (“Reseller”), instead of paying ERP.net, you will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between you and the Reseller. We may suspend or terminate your rights to use Cloud Services if we do not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller.

Your order details (e.g., the Cloud Services you are entitled to use, the number of Users, the Billing Period, etc.) will be as stated in the Order Form placed with us by the Reseller on your behalf, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order Form as communicated to us.

If you are entitled to a refund under this Agreement, then unless we otherwise specify, we will refund any applicable Fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to you.

Resellers are not authorized to modify this Agreement or make any promises or commitments on our behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth.

The amount paid or payable by the Reseller to us for your use of the applicable Cloud Services under this Agreement will be deemed the amount actually paid or payable by you to us under this Agreement for purposes of calculating the liability cap.

### 9.11. No contingencies on other products of future functionality

You acknowledge that the Cloud Services and Additional Services referenced in an Order Form are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services. Payment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other services (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Services and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Order Form). You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Services beyond the duration of this Agreement), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features.

## 10. Tax

Fees and other charges imposed under an Order Form will not include taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”), all of which will be for Customer’s account. Customer is responsible for all taxes, other than ERP.net’s income and payroll taxes. Customer must provide to ERP.net any direct pay permits or valid tax-exempt certificates prior to signing an Order Form. If ERP.net has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, ERP.net will invoice Customer and they will pay that amount unless Customer provides ERP.net with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, ERP.net is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property and employees.

### 10.1. Withholding Taxes

You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes. You and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available. If we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof. You will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.

## 11. Termination and Cancellations

### 11.1. Termination

#### 11.1.1. Termination for Cause

Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after notice; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).

If a Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with this Section, ERP.net will refund the Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Billing Period after the effective date of termination. If ERP.net terminates this Agreement in accordance with this Section, ERP.net will retain any prepaid fees under the Subscription Billing Model and Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering past usage under the Usage Billing Model.

#### 11.1.2. Termination for Convenience

This Agreement will terminate:

(i)	Upon receipt of a written notice by the Customer to ERP.net that the Customer wishes to terminate the Agreement, at any time and for any reason;
(ii)	Upon the ‘Contract End Date’ in the applicable Order Form, if such is specified therein.

Upon any such termination (i) you will not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees and (ii) if you have not already paid all applicable fees for the then-current Billing Period (for example, fees covering past usage under the Usage Billing Model or additional fees for an increase in Services), any such fees that are outstanding will become immediately due and payable.

### 11.2. Consequence of termination

Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, you must cease using all Cloud Services and delete (or at our request, return) all Confidential Information or other materials of ours in your possession, including on any third-party systems operated on your behalf. You will certify such deletion upon our request. You will not have access to Your Data (and we may delete all of Your Data unless legally prohibited) after the termination of this Agreement, so you should make sure to export Your Data using the functionality of the Cloud Services while the Agreement is in force. In no event will termination relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination. Except where an exclusive remedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.

### 11.3. Survival

The following provisions will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms: Sections 4.2. (Responsibilities), 4.3 (Security), 5.3 (Responsibility for Users), 6.3 (Third-Party Developers), 7 (Use and restriction of the platform), 8 (Privacy and information), 9.5 (No refunds), 9.6 (Overdue Charges),9.8 (Fees), 12 (Liability and indemnities), 14 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction).

Our sole liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, for any breach of the Warranty are set forth in this Section.

#### 12.1.4. Warranty disclaimer

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 6.1 (SYSTEM AVAILABILITY), ALL CLOUD SERVICES AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, FUNCTIONALITY OR MERCHANTABILITY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF THE CLOUD SERVICES NECESSARILY INVOLVES TRANSMISSION OF YOUR DATA OVER NETWORKS THAT WE DO NOT OWN, OPERATE OR CONTROL, AND WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF YOUR DATA LOST, ALTERED, INTERCEPTED OR STORED ACROSS SUCH NETWORKS. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT OUR SECURITY PROCEDURES WILL BE ERROR-FREE, THAT TRANSMISSIONS OF YOUR DATA WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE OR THAT UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTIES WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DEFEAT OUR SECURITY MEASURES OR THOSE OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.

### 12.2. Liability

#### 12.2.1. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY TOGETHER WITH ALL OF ITS AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER AND ITS AFFILIATES HEREUNDER FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE FIRST INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION WILL APPLY WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY BUT WILL NOT LIMIT CUSTOMER'S AND ITS AFFILIATES’ PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.

#### 12.2.2	Exclusion of Consequential and Related Damages

IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, GOODWILL, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF A PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF A PARTY’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ REMEDY OTHERWISE FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.

#### 12.2.3. IP Indemnification
