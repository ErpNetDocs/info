# Welcome

Welcome to the ERP.net information site!

## About

@@name is a comprehensive cloud ERP-CRM platform, accessible from web, desktop, and mobile.
It can be used to manage multiple legal entities in a single ERP instance, sharing processes and definitions.
ERP.net tightly integrates a lot of applications and has a unique hybrid integration model, balancing between the all-in-one and best-of-breed approaches.

Use this site to get detailed information about the @@name platform - general information such as features, apps, modules, licensing models, system information, terms and conditions, etc.
The information is geared towards prospective customers, previewing ERP.net for their ERP implementation plans, as well as existing ones, eager to learn more about newly released modules and apps or upgrades and modernizations of existing functionalities.

@@name takes a different approach than most vendors to the ERP selection process.
The selection of a new ERP is a major decision for any company and such a decision requires significant research.
Hence, this info site is structured as an academic research site with as little as possible marketing stuff.

@@name is an ERP platform built around explicit models, rules, and constraints.
Instead of relying on slogans or abstractions, we explain how the system works, what it enforces, and why that matters for organizations that care about correctness and long-term predictability.
