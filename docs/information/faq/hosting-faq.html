<h2 id="high-availability--monitoring">High Availability &amp; Monitoring</h2>
<h3 id="does-the--service-feature-high-availability">Does the ERP.net service feature high availability?</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There are many components in an ERP instance - database,
application servers, web servers, apps, reverse proxy, process manager, etc.
Each component is hosted on a hardware, which is always having a
stand-by backup hardware, ready to take over in a case of a hardware failure.</p>
<p>All network components are also stacked for high availability.
Each network component is cross-connected to each host.</p>
<p>The point is, there is no single point of failure.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-platform-availability--offers">What is the platform availability ERP.net offers?</h3>
<p>As a cloud-native, web-based software, the ERP.net platform offers a world-class hosting quality and availability.</p>
<p>In this sense, the monthly availability of the platform always exceeds 99.5 per cent.
The rest up to a 100 per cent is most often than not due to rare, short interruptions for system maintenance that go on for a couple of minutes (often done outside normal working hours).</p>
<p>The annual availability of ERP.net is well above these levels, achieving uptimes of 99.95 per cent and more.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>In the unlikely event that the platform availability goes below the standards we guarantee in our terms of use, users are eligible to file requests for compensations.</p>
<p>Further information about ERP.net's uptime commitments, eligibility for compensations, and compensation amounts can be found in our <strong><a href="../../legal/platform-terms-of-use.html">Platform Terms of Use</a></strong>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="is-the-system-monitored-at-all-times">Is the system monitored at all times?</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There is a dedicated team, monitoring all systems 24x7x365.
In case of an issue, reaction time is usually in the 5-15 minutes range, day and night.</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-in-case-of-a-hardware-problem">What happens in case of a hardware problem?</h3>
<p>The most important part is the problem to be automatically
detected by the watchdog systems.</p>
<p>Once the problem is detected, an automatic failover occurs.
The failover is usually within 30-60 seconds.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the users might notice just a slight delay in their processing.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-reaction-time-in-case-of-an-issue">What is the reaction time in case of an issue?</h3>
<p>First of all, most issues auto-resolve themselves,
because each component has high-availability and the workload is automatically
transferred to another node.</p>
<p>However, should it reach to a human intervention, the reaction time usually is
within 5-15 minutes, day and night, 24x7x365.</p>
<h3 id="is-the-system-monitored-from-outside">Is the system monitored from outside?</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There are at least two different locations,
usually in different countries or states,
which has automatic watchdogs setup.</p>
<p>Each alarm for non-availability is reviewed by human operators.</p>
<h2 id="disaster-recovery--backups">Disaster Recovery &amp; Backups</h2>
<h3 id="are-there-backups-of-my-data">Are there backups of my data?</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We hope you are joking and this is a rhetorical question ðŸ™‚.</p>
<p>Seriously, the backup planning, execution and control is one of most important activities out there.
You can read more about backups in the <a href="../system-information/disaster-recovery.html">Disaster Recovery</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="is-the-off-site-backup-included-in-the-price">Is the off-site backup included in the price?</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The off-site backup is included in the price for all subscription levels.
You do not need to do anything in order to be fully protected.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3 id="what-hardware-is-used-for-the-service">What hardware is used for the service?</h3>
<p>There are a lot of moving parts in a proper ERP service.
Reliability is the most important factor when choosing the correct hardware.
Performance comes second, but is also of paramount importance.</p>
<p>It is hard to describe all hardware, but here are some quick facts:</p>
<p>Database servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top of the line, data center grade, specialized frequency optimized CPU.
These usually cost around 10 times more per core than regular CPUs.</li>
<li>32 GB RAM per core.</li>
<li>Specialized memory-class SSD drives for caching and temp db.</li>
<li>Top of the line SSDs for databases.</li>
<li>100 Gbit network connections to backup and hot-stand-by server.</li>
<li>25 Gbit network connection to application servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Application servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise grade general-purpose CPU for application processing.</li>
<li>8 GB (up from 4 until 2023) RAM per application core.</li>
<li>SSDs for storage.</li>
<li>25 Gbit network connections</li>
</ul>
<p>Network components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise grade routers, switches, firewalls, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-database-size-to-expect">What database size to expect?</h3>
<p>Database sizes vary depending on many factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular user processing.</li>
<li>Automation by applications.</li>
<li>Storage of documents, pictures, etc.</li>
<li>Use of <a class="xref" href="https://erpnetdocs.github.io/tech/advanced/data-objects/track-changes.html">Track Changes</a> feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>We can only try to predict, with big tolerance for error, the regular user processing.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, each user generates approximately between 0.25 and 1.00 GB of data per year.</p>
