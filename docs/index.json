    "keywords": "ERP.net Data Warehouse The information powerhouse of your organization In the information-dominated business landscape, making use and making sense of accumulated data is becoming core to gaining knowledge and making informed decisions. Organizations are collecting so much data that storing and processing it becomes a significant challenge. It is still a common practice for companies to create numerous Excel tables to handle the data accrued. While Excel tables are great for organizing and sorting data sets and applying basic calculations and formulas, when it comes to storing, controling, and analyzing vast amounts of data from different sources to support business intelligence, mere tables will not cut it. Even a simple everyday example, such as having multiple versions of the same Excel file saved or edited by different users or accidentally deleting crucial Excel file or field value can help highlight the need for a more streamlined method of handling and utilizing company data. Organizations need a single source of truth within their ERP system where all data is stored and managed, as opposed to having chunks of information living in disparate tables across systems and users. Enter the ERP.net Data Warehouse module – the digital storage of all your organization’s information. The module collects, connects, and harmonizes data from a number of disparate sources, systems, databases, or even companies. This central repository stores integrated data – both current and historical – and is the key ingredient for business analysis, reporting, and insight. With the Data Warehouse , data from heterogenous and external sources is properly formatted and stored, so that queries and analysis can be easily performed by any BI system to get a current and long-range view of data over time. Business analysts use such information: As the basis of balance scorecards To cut data into dimensions Measure performance over time Benchmark and compare target values and key parameters Combine data from a number of ERP systems and visualize reports within the built-in BI panels of ERP.net navigators Take control of your data Apart from helping analysts make sense of accrued financial, accounting, and performance data, Data Warehouse helps teams enter and operate with everyday data more easily and get a more profound overview of data within their workflows. For example, team members can enter information about sales within a specific time period, even for periods before the ERP system was implemented, or commonplace information, such as visits of sales associates with prospects. All audit records are stored within the module and access is restricted only to users with the proper rights granted. Version history of all entries is accessible and available via track changes . As with the rest of the ERP.net system, you can easily customize and add new fields to the list of predefined ones, based on your specific needs or scenario. Get meaningul information from ERP.net navigators Information input need not be a nuisance – with the Data Warehouse module you can simply copy and paste data in the navigator – in the same field sequence as in your Excel table. You can then grant different levels of access rights to stakeholders, edit or update field data , and define which fields need to keep their historical versions. What’s more – your team will appreciate the chat functionality that helps colleagues be in sync and discuss real-time what information needs an update, debate over field values, or analyze sales data on the go. Apart from being a collaboration tool, you can also use the chat as a simple project management tool to assign tasks to team members, send notifications, and track task execution. Multiple Excel files are a thing of the past Summing it up – in addition to being the data powerhouse of your business, Data Warehouse helps teams conduct complex data operations in a simple, yet effective manner. Managers can make data-driven decisions based on financial and operating reporting grounded on data from different sources and systems that is stored and analyzed within the ERP.net platform and its native BI functionality. You can also integrate and utilize external applications for analysis and reporting, such as Power BI. With the Data Warehouse module, you can: Store large amounts of current and historic data within your ERP.net system Collect and format data from disparate systems and sources Make queries and use data as basis for BI analysis and reporting Devise balance scorecards to compare and analyze target values, parameters, and performance over time Empower teams to easily enter, edit, and understand data Use the built-in chat functionality as a collaboration and project management tool"

Integration Module Accounting is fully integrated with the main system and changes in other modules are automatically reflected in the accounting records. This eliminates double data entry, saving time and costs. Automation The module automates various processes, such as creating accounting entries and all document types, currency revaluation, calculation of depreciation of assets, revaluation of receivables from customers and payables to suppliers, and finalization of accounts. With the module, economic transactions are accounted for under preset templates. Accounting templates are a mechanism to indicate the system how to account for primary documents. They also allow you to define common operations in order to facilitate and accelerate entering accounting information. The creation of an accounting template requires setting a sequence of operations. In each operation, it is defined where to take a sum from and which account to put it in. Accounting templates are a very important tool to achieve maximum automation of labor. After the initial setup by an accountant, they allow you to distribute the tasks for entering primary data between accountants and people performing business transactions.

Example - Get default payment term days Suppose, that in a Sales Order, we want to display the customers default payment term (in days). In the Sales Order, we can define the following Calculated Attribute: No Operation Param1 Param2 Param3 10 GETREF REF:Customer ATTRIB:DefaultPaymentTermDays Explanation: GETREF - gets information from a related entity.

For example, the Product Name of a Product can be entered in many languages simultaneously. When visualizing the data, the correct language version of the string is displayed automatically by the system, depending on the current user language. Note For reports, the report designer can specify whether to use the current user language or always use a fixed language. For example, for a Portuguese invoice, one would require that the labels and data are always displayed in Portuguese. Entering data in multiple languages The client applications of ERP.net usually allow the following abilities regarding multi-language strings: Enter the string in many languages Transliterate a string from one language to another (or all) Translate a string from one language to another (or all) When entering translations for a multi-language string, the client application usually displays a table with cells for each language translation, similar to this: Language Value EN: Toothpaste DE: Zahnpasta Depending on the client application, translation can sometimes also be automated. Some client applications support using an online service, like Google Translate to automatically translate a string to other languages. Translation is better suited to Description and Notes attributes. Transliteration Transliteration is the process of translating one language version of a string to another, based on the sounding of the string. Transliteration works great for person and company names and addresses. It allows branch offices to work in their local language and reports can still be shown in the corporate language. For example, the Russian word \"Иван\" would be transliterated in English as \"Ivan\". Transliteration works in two ways - manual and automatic. Manual transliteration \"Manual\" transliteration is actually automatic, but is initiated manually while editing the different language versions of a multi-language string. While editing multi-language string, the client application usually provides a function button, which transliterates the current language version to other languages. Automatic transliteration Automatic transliteration occurs when the system needs to display some a multi-language string in some language, but that specific language translation is not saved in the database. For example, suppose one employee works in a branch office in Russia and enters \"Иван\" as a person first name. The database saves only the Russian language version. Then another employee at a UK location requests to see the first name of the same person. The system would automatically transliterate the string and display it as \"Ivan\". Note Transliteration works optimally between Latin and Cyrillic."

The module provides accurate, real-time information on inventory and shares it with the other subsystems of the ERP system. The solution provides a single point for receiving orders for performing warehouse operations, whether these are orders for shipment (from the CRM subsystem) requests for discharge of materials (from the Production subsystem) or transfer orders to another warehouse (from the supply module). Similarly, served are orders to receive purchased goods, logging in production and accepting products from other stores. The module provides a unified methodology for monitoring the implementation of warehouse orders, including alarms for delays and more. With the software, you can turn warehouses into a structure of storage locations. Storage locations can be roughly defined sections of the storage space or alternatively they can have a precise hierarchy with the position of each product. Thus, the module can provide navigated deployment and picking up of products from a warehouse. This means the system can direct warehouse workers to specific storage locations when they have to store new products or prepare goods for shipping. There are several methods to do this: Preparation by order — the navigation calculates the most economical route to the warehouse for the preparation of all products, order by order Group preparation by storage locations — the navigation indicates the shortest route for group preparation of several orders simultaneously The Warehouse Management Module also supports inventory planning, preparation and implementation. Inventory operations can be full or partial — by products or by storage spaces. In addition, the system can print out an inventory sheet which can be filled out by hand and then uploaded to a computer to check for discrepancies. In order to fully support warehouse operations, ERP.net comes with integrated support for barcode and RFID readers. This way you can use such devices in all warehouse operations. Input data for the implementation of warehouse activities can be sent from external systems — automated lines, palmtops, etc. This happens though a universal interface, which you can leverage to set up fully automated reporting of storage operations. In addition, the system also has built-in reporting features for planned and unplanned scraps. It is reported by reasons and can also be summed and analysed by reasons."

    "keywords": "Zone Based Routing The basic idea With Zone based routing, the rules for processing the goods are determined based on the zone, in which the goods are stored for each step. The zones are sequentially numbered, relative to their \"closeness\" to final shipping. For example: 1 IN -> 2 INSP -> 3 BULK -> 4 PICK -> 5 KIT -> 6 PACK -> 7 OUT RECEIVE ------------> --OPTIMIZE--> ----------------> DISPATCH The main processes in the warehouse - receive, optimize and dispatch, are ordered consecutively through the zone sequence. The receive process starts at the inbound docks and runs until goods are placed in bulk. The optimization process usually deals with replenishment of the picking zones, but can also be used for pre-kitting. The planning of the dispatch process works backwards - from the final step (the dispatch from the outbound docks) to the first step (usually picking). This is similar to how MRP/DRP works, but applied for WMS. Zone based routing and sequencing provides great flexibility in the route formation process, while keeping things simple and understandable for the process designers. It allows the process designers to focus separately on each zone, leaving the complex full routing formation to the system. Zone based routing allows programming of very complicated routes, while still keeping things simple and maintainable. How it works? For each zone, there are rules, which define how the goods will be processed, when they pass the zone. The rules for a zone are defined separately for each of the WMS processes - receive, dispatch and replenishment. The full route is the concatenation of all route steps for each consecutive zone. Hierarchical rules Since zones are hierarchical, for any given zone there might be multiple rules, coming from different levels of the hierarchy. All rules in the hierarchy are combined when creating the routing. Combining the rules is performed separately for each STEP NO within each zone. To determine the \"winning\" rule for each step, the RULE PRIORITY is used within all rules, which satisfy the RULE CONDITIONs. Start and finish of the process The receive process starts at the inbound dock and is planned through the zones, until there are no more steps. Usually, it finishes at the BULK zone. The dispatch process works in the opposite way - it first determines the quantities needed at the outbound docks, and than determines what previous steps could supply these quantities. The optimization process is a middle ground - it just runs for all zones, for which there is a definition for the optimization process. Related topics: Zone-based routing examples"

    "keywords": "Capacity Requirements Planning Capacity requirements planning (CRP) is “the function of establishing, measuring, and adjusting limits or levels of capacity. … the process of determining in detail the amount of labor and machine resources required to accomplish the tasks of production.” Source: APICS® Dictionary, 10th edition, stock number 01102.1 / 02, ISBN: 1-55822-191-3 The module makes it very easy to plan capacity requirements and update the production plan – a task usually considered difficult. It offers very convenient tools to graphically represent production programs. You can make daily adjustments to the production plan with just a few clicks, and the edited operation moves to another day or hour. How does CRP work? When a new product for manufacturing is entered in the system, It needs to be assigned a production technology which defines the machines and the length of processing it is supposed to go through. In order for the production technology to be described, the system needs to have information about the available resources (machines) and their production capacity. When the system calculates a production schedule, it checks the needs of all products and tries to match them with the available resources. The system sorts orders according by priority and monitors production deadlines. If there is a problem that interferes with the time limit, the system will warn you and mark the order in red, so you can check it and decide how to proceed. Although the system can automatically calculate production schedules, the final decision is yours. You can approve a schedule or modify it. It is often necessary to implement emergency orders, which rearranges the approved plan. To avoid this situation, production management theory recommends to plan a resource load of 75% -95%, depending on manufacturing specifics and batch sizes, but never 100%. Capacity requirements planning requires efforts – you need to enter information about you resources, technologies and products in advance. But this work will pay off because ERP.net CRP will drastically increase the efficiency and effectiveness of your employees in charge of planning."

Together, the production modules of ERP.net bring significant advantages to the companies in the sector. The ERP system features powerful tools for material planning, scheduling and monitoring of production capacity load. It also allows for each item to be assigned specific recipes and principal recipes and facilitates the management of complex manufacturing processes. ERP.net Production has a capacity planning module which turns the complex task of planning and continuously updating production schedules into quite an easy and affordable activity. The material planning module provides industrial units with the necessary products and materials at the right time and the right place. There is also a specific production module to manage the core of manufacturing. It creates production orders, to monitor inputs, are taken into consideration the activities and the resulting end products. In addition, the modules are integrated with a unique tool that allows businesses to easily create and cost estimate new products and categories. New product models can be easily configured according to customer requirements, no matter how complex and specific they are. Modules ERP.net Production consists of 4 main modules: Product technologies - it enables the manufacturer to form the components of each item and the operational steps and supports multiple recipes for a single product type Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP) - it monitors the percentage load of manufacturing resources, the scheduling of production activities, and Gantt charts Material Requirements Planning (MRP) - it takes care of production planning and supply Shop Floor Control (SFC) - it manages the core manufacturing process. In the module, the manufacturer can create production orders, monitor inputs, and make reports about activities (used materials and operations) and production"

    "keywords": "Material Requirements Planning The main purpose of module Material requirements planning (MRP), together with subsystem Logistics, in ERP.net is to provide products and materials at the right time, the right place. The module is meant to maintain a smooth logistics process based on formulations, technology, orders from customers and to suppliers, inventory, sales projections, etc. In case of shortage of a raw material, semi-finished or finished product, the system alerts the relevant staff and offers supply suggestions which can be approved with one click. Integration with other modules in the system The MRP module, together with subsystem Logistics, provides all necessary means to completely cover the logistics process in any business. Control of supplies planned by the system In case of shortage of a raw material, semi-finished or finished product, the system alerts the relevant staff and offers supply suggestions which can be approved with one click. Planning methods supported by the system Shortfall products can be obtained in several ways: In-house production CMT production from an external counterparty Purchase Transfer from another warehouse The module can support a preferred method of planning for each product. The system supports both centralized and decentralized planning. For example, you can set the module to offer purchase from a supplier in case of shortage in the central warehouse, while deficits in other warehouses can trigger a suggestion to transfer from the central one. There is also one more option – if there is a shortage in any warehouse, a purchase from an external supplier can be planned. The quantity dimension of any shortfall can be calculated by several methods: Minimum availability – if availability falls below a certain minimum amount, the system suggests an order to reach back the target value. Calculating MRP – this method calculates the exact amount which is necessary for the planning period. Economic order – comparing the cost for preparing and and transportation of an order to the cost of storing these goods in a warehouse. At regular intervals – this method offers to order the quantity consumed during the previous interval. Once you precise amount, the system can adjust it to meet certain criteria. The criteria that the system supports are: Batch size – with this criterion, orders are always multiples of the given size. Minimum/maximum – the supplier may require a minimum (more often) or a maximum amount of an order. Using the given methods and criteria, the system calculates and suggests an order. The final decision on the confirmation or modification of the suggestion, however, is taken by an employee working with the program. You must keep in mind that accurate supply operations require the following subsystems to also function with a high level of precision: Inventory management – if inventory data is not up-to-date and real-time, the supply system may generate inaccurate order suggestions. Sales projections – projections of future sales are not mandatory but can contribute to the optimization of supply suggestions. Customer orders – they reveal the real-life demand for finished products, and if they are not entered correctly, supply will give inaccurate suggestions. Recipes in manufacturing – they are used to decompose the needs for finished products to needs for materials or manufactured products. If recipes are not true, it will lead to erroneous suggestions for supply. Document types The module works with several document types that cover the entire supply process: Transfer order – for the transfer of goods from a warehouse/storage space to another warehouse/storage space. Replenishment order – this is an order that addresses the need for products in a warehouse. It can come from different departments and is created by demand, with specifying a * supplier and prices not being obligatory. Such an order is processed by the Supply Department, which then uses it to generate a purchase order. Purchase order – such an order can be proposed by the system (document status: Planned) or made manually. It indicates an intention to buy a product from a specific provider, at a certain (optional) price. Receiving order – this type of document provides input control over supplies and a comparison between the ordered goods, the received goods and the invoice – the so-called “triple-check.” Module Material planning has high requirements to function properly but the benefits it brings are many times more than the efforts for its implementation. With this module, you can have more timely dispatches and optimize inventory and the time to process an order. The module is suitable for use by both manufacturing and distribution companies. One solution for the entire organization ERP.net is a solution that can cover all key business processes in your company. It does not matter whether the individual modules are implemented simultaneously or added at a later stage, they will always be fully integrated. You can use the accumulated data from all modules to make detailed reports that let you analyze your results in detail and prepare budgets and projections for future periods."

When creating a technological route, each operation is assigned a main resource (work center) where it is performed, as well as specific duration and other parameters that define the production process in detail. Each operation is associated with the relevant, to-be-processed materials (components) of the final product, as well as the production resources and tools used in the operation. On the back of this information, the system facilitates planning of the production process. It can automatically suggest a plan that takes into account the necessary materials. The created technology serves as a template of materials in production reporting.

Without touching your mouse, you can simply hit the Enter key and jump straight to the next important data entry. You can define which form fields can be navigated to with the Enter key, so that upon a keystroke, only these fields get highlighted to be edited. These are called Enter stops. You can also use Enter stops to quickly navigate not only to fields and lines but also to whole panels. Of course, all other fields and panels are still visible and editable. Thus, users, roles within the company, or the whole company, for that matter, can streamline processes, based on task or form specifics. For example, when you enter a new sales order, the form may contain lots of fields that may not be relevant to your role or to the task at hand. Usually you just need to enter details about the product ordered, its price and required quantity. Thus, to save your time and avoid clicking through every single field or panel of the form, you select as Enter stops only the fields and panels applicable to your current workflow and context, so that you can quickly navigate to them, skipping all the rest."

There are many components in an ERP instance - database, application servers, web servers, apps, reverse proxy, process manager, etc. Each component is hosted on a hardware, which is always having a stand-by backup hardware, ready to take over in a case of a hardware failure. All network components are also stacked for high availability. Each network component is cross-connected to each host. The point is, there is no single point of failure. Is the system monitored at all times? Yes. There is a dedicated team, monitoring all systems 24x7x365. In case of an issue, reaction time is usually in the 5-15 minutes range, day and night. What happens in case of a hardware problem? The most important part is the problem to be automatically detected by the watchdog systems. Once the problem is detected, an automatic failover occurs. The failover is usually within 30-60 seconds. Most of the time, the users might notice just a slight delay in their processing. What is the reaction time in case of an issue? First of all, most issues auto-resolve themselves, because each component has high-availability and the workload is automatically transferred to another node. However, should it reach to a human intervention, the reaction time usually is within 5-15 minutes, day and night, 24x7x365. Is the system monitored from outside? Yes. There are at least two different locations, usually in different countries or states, which has automatic watchdogs setup. Each alarm for non-availability is reviewed by human operators. Disaster Recovery & Backups Are there backups of my data? Yes. We hope you are joking and this is a rhetorical question 🙂. Seriously, the backup planning, execution and control is one of most important activities out there. You can read more about backups in the Disaster Recovery section. Is the off-site backup included in the price? Yes. The off-site backup is included in the price for all subscription levels. You do not need to do anything in order to be fully protected. Miscellaneous What hardware is used for the service? There are a lot of moving parts in a proper ERP service. Reliability is the most important factor when choosing the correct hardware. Performance comes second, but is also of paramount importance. It is hard to describe all hardware, but here are some quick facts: Database servers: Top of the line, data center grade, specialized frequency optimized CPU. These usually cost around 10 times more per core than regular CPUs. 32 GB RAM per core. Optane SSD drives for caching and temp db. NVMe SSDs for databases. 2 x 100 Gbit network to stand-by server. 4 x 10 Gbit network connection to application servers. Application servers: Enterprise grade general-purpose CPU for application processing. 4 GB RAM per application core. SSDs for storage. 2 x 10 Gbit/s network connection Network components: Enterprise grade Cisco routers, switches and firewalls. What database size to expect? Database sizes vary depending on many factors: Regular user processing. Automation by applications. Storage of documents, pictures, etc. Use of Track Changes feature. etc. We can only try to predict, with big tolerance for error, the regular user processing. As a rule of thumb, each user generates approximately between 0.25 and 1.00 GB of data per year."

User Groups Permissions are managed through User Groups. A user group gives access to a list of access keys. The members of the user group receive access to all keys in the group. Note There is no way to revoke access to specific access key for specific user. When a user is added to a security group, they receive all keys. Design carefully your security framework, so that revoking is not required. Action permissions Access keys give general permission to access a resource. This gives the permission to retrieve the resource from the database. However, this might not give permission for specific operations (actions) over the resource. Each resource type has a pre-defined set of actions, which might require permissions. When a security group is assigned an access key, the assignment also specifies which actions are allowed.

ERP.net is not liable for any damages caused to the Customer by unregistered Reseller. 5.2.3. Liability Any additional Services, including support, account management, Bundles and special offers are provided according to the additional rules for Resellers located on the ERP.net Reseller web page. The ERP.net limits its liability for any actions and omissions of a Reseller, subject to the limitations in section 12, and may, at their discretion, assist a Customer in resolving the issue. 5.2.4. Resellers as Administrators If Customer order Cloud Services through a Reseller, then the Customer is responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in the applicable agreement with the Reseller. As between Customer and ERP.net, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other User Accounts. 5.3. Responsibility for Users Some Cloud Services require Users to be designated by Administrators and some may allow Users to invite other Users. The appointed Administrator is responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Service you use and for controlling whom you allow to become a User. If payment is required for Users to use or access a Cloud Services, then we are only required to provide the Cloud Services to those Users for whom you have paid the applicable fees, and only such Users are permitted to access and use the Cloud Services. Some Cloud Services may allow you to designate different types of Users, in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of User. You are responsible for compliance with this Agreement by all Users, including for any payment obligations. You are responsible for the activities of all Users, including Order Forms they may place and how Users use Your Data, even if those Users are not from your organization or domain. The Administrator and the Customer are directly responsible for any damages resulting from User activity. 6. Platform rights and responsibilities 6.1. System Availability 6.1.1. Service Level Commitment ERP.net commits to provide 99.5% uptime with respect to the Customer’s Service during each calendar month of the Agreement Term, excluding regular maintenance times and Unforeseen events or actions. If in any calendar month this uptime commitment is not met by ERP.net and Customer was negatively impacted (i.e., attempted to log into or access the Service and failed due to the unscheduled downtime of the Service), ERP.net shall provide, as the sole and exclusive remedy, a credit note equal to 50% of a monthly fee for the use of the Service. 6.1.2. Scheduled and Unscheduled Maintenance Scheduled maintenance times does not count as downtime. Unscheduled Maintenance will be counted against the uptime guarantee unless such maintenance is preformed when it’s necessary to ensure a higher level of security and stability of the Services. 6.1.2.1. Scheduled Maintenance Maintenance time is scheduled if it is communicated with an Administrator at least two full business days in advance of the maintenance time. Scheduled maintenance time typically is to occur at night on the weekend. Scheduled maintenance is performed once or twice a year. 6.1.2.2. Unscheduled Maintenance ERP.net in its sole discretion may take the Service down for Unscheduled maintenance and in that event will attempt to notify Customer and/or Administrator in advance. Unscheduled Maintenance, which is performed when it’s necessary to ensure a higher level of security and stability of the Services will be typically scheduled to occur at night - 10:00 pm - 12:30 am, based on the time zone of the Cloud Server location, chosen by Administrator or Customer in the Order Form, and should not exceed one hour. 6.1.3. Postponement of an update Depending on the Support Services and Usage Limits, specified in the Order Forms by the Customer, ERP.net offers shared or private servers to its Customers. Customers who use shared servers do not have the opportunity to postpone scheduled upgrades and such are done according to the information on the official site and by the terms in Section 6.1.2. Customer with private servers have the option to postpone the update. The updates can be postponed only once and for maximum 1 (one) month. Customer should open a support ticket, based on the procedure in Section 6.2., indicating the period for which the update should be postponed. Non-updated servers pose security and maintenance risks, therefore ERP.net cannot guarantee the normal operation or full functionality of the system during this time. ERP.net will not be responsible, during this period, for any data leaks, security problems, system malfunction or difficulties accessing the Cloud Services. 6.1.4. Credit note request In order to receive a credit note under this service level commitment, Customer must request it simply by emailing ERP.net billing e-mail, no later than five days after the end of the applicable month. If Customer submits a credit request and does not receive a prompt automated response indicating that the request was received, Customer must resubmit the request because the submission was not properly received and will not result in a credit. The issued credit note is automatically deducted from the next monthly invoice. ERP.net shall calculate any service level downtime using ERP.net’s system logs and other records. 6.1.5. Refusal of credit ERP.net reserves the right to refuse to issue a credit note in case any of the following conditions are not met: At the time of the system unavailability, the Customer should not be in default or past due any of the payments to ERP.net or their Affiliates. Customer should not have breached any of the contractual obligation before or after the system unavailability. 6.2. Support 6.2.1. Bugs and problems For the duration of this Agreement, ERP.net commits to making all reasonable efforts to remedy any Bug of the Cloud Services submitted by the Customer through the appropriate channel (typically, the web form or phone numbers listed on the Help page, or when working with a Reseller, the channel provided by them), and to start handling such Customer submissions within 2 business days. The period of 2 business days starts from the moment when a complete and detailed report about the Bug/s is provided, which should have a minimum information about: (a) what functionality was used, (b) what was the intended result, (c) what are the steps that were taken before the problem occurred, (d) what was the status of the user who tried to perform the action. As soon as the Bug is fixed an appropriate remedy will be communicated to the Customer. Both parties acknowledge that as specified in the license of the Cloud Services and in Section 12 of this Agreement, ERP.net cannot be held liable for Bugs in the Cloud Services. 6.2.2. Scope For the duration of this Agreement, the Customer may open up to 10 (ten) support tickets per month for each instance of Cloud Platform they have, free of charge. The support tickets should cover questions regarding Bugs or Performance and Connectivity issues. Other assistance requests, such as questions related to development or customizations may be covered through the purchase of a separate Support services Agreement. In case it’s not clear, if a request is covered by this Agreement, the decision is at the discretion of ERP.net. 6.2.3. Availability Tickets can be submitted via the web form or phone numbers listed on Help page. If a Customer is working with a Reseller, they can also send tickets thru the channel provided by the Reseller, subject to their working hours. 6.3. Third-Party developers 6.3.1. Third-party’s products and services ERP.net or Third-party may make available (for example, through the Marketplace or otherwise) Third-party products or services, including, for example, Third-party Applications and implementation and other Consulting services. Any acquisition by Customer of such products or services, and any exchange of data between Customer and any Third-party’s product or service is solely between Customer and the applicable Third-party. ERP.net does not warrant or support Third-party Applications or other Third-party products or services, whether or not they are designated by ERP.net as “certified” or otherwise, unless expressly provided otherwise in an Order Form. ERP.net is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data resulting from access by such Third-party Application or its provider. 6.3.2. Integration with Third-party Applications The Services may contain features designed to interoperate with Third-party Applications. ERP.net cannot guarantee the continued availability of such Service features and may cease providing them without entitling Customer to any refund, credit, or other compensation, if for example and without limitation, the provider of a Third-party Application ceases to make the Third-party Application available for interoperation with the corresponding Service features in a manner acceptable to ERP.net. 6.3.3. Removal of Content and Third-party Applications If Customer receives notice that Third-party Application must be removed, modified and/or disabled to avoid violating applicable law, third-party rights, Customer will promptly do so. If Customer does not take required action in accordance with the above, or if in ERP.net’s judgment continued violation is likely to reoccur, ERP.net may disable the applicable Service and/or Third-party Application. If requested by ERP.net, Customer shall confirm such deletion and discontinuance of use in writing and ERP.net shall be authorized to provide a copy of such confirmation to any such third-party claimant or governmental authority, as applicable. In addition, if ERP.net is required by any third-party rights holder to remove content or receives information that content provided to Customer may violate applicable law or third-party rights, ERP.net may discontinue Customer’s access to content through the Services. 6.3.4. Marketplace apps and tools ERP.net offers applications developed by them or by third-parties through its official Marketplace, which are certified and have met the minimum requirements for working with Cloud services and software. However, each Customer has the right to use applications in conjunction with Cloud services that are not downloaded from the Marketplace, and Customer guarantees that they and their work with them will not violate the rules of this Agreement. ERP.net certifies the various applications so that the Customer can choose safe and reliable applications for their work process. ERP.net ensures that the applications uploaded to the Marketplace (class A) meet the minimum requirements for security and reliability, and that they do not collect unnecessary information about the Customer. All applications that are not in class A are uncertified and ERP.net does not give any guarantees or warranties if the Customer chooses to integrate such applications in its work. 7. Use and restriction of the platform 7.1. Usage Limits Services are subject to usage limits specified in Order Forms and Documentation. If Customer exceeds a contractual usage limit, ERP.net may work with Customer to seek to reduce Customer’s usage so that it conforms to that limit. If, notwithstanding ERP.net’s efforts, Customer is unable or unwilling to abide by a contractual usage limit, Customer will execute an Order Form for additional quantities of the applicable Services promptly upon ERP.net’s request, and/or pay any invoice for excess usage in accordance with the “Invoicing and Payment” section below. The use of one User account by several different Users is expressly prohibited and will be considered a gross violation of this Agreement, which may result in termination of all Services without notice. This limit doesn’t apply for Business Partners accounts. If a Business Partner should access the system, a request for this is submitted through the platform and a Business Partner account of the given legal entity is created, which can be accessed by several Users. Additionally, the ERP.net may, at its discretion, provide Free services under section 4.1.5. to Customer who they consider that is classified for them according to the internal ERP.net rules (universities, non-governmental organizations, churches). In such cases, the usage is limited to the resources that the ERP.net has decided to provide free of charge and according to the constraints it deems appropriate for the need of the Customer, stated in the Order Form. 7.1.1. Different type of usage limits Session Based – this is a type of limitation that entitles the Customer to use the Cloud Service by User sessions, regardless of who the individual User is. In this case the number of licenses is equal to the number of User sessions, which can be performed simultaneously by Users of the Customer, which means there are no restriction on the number of registered Users. User Based – this is a type of limitation that entitles 1 /one/ individual User, identified in an Order Form, or in another appropriate way, to use the Cloud Services. In this case, the number of licenses is equal to the number of individual Users who can use the Cloud Services, which means there are restriction on the number of registered Users. Resource Based – this is a type of limitation that gives the Customer the right to use a certain capacity of the Cloud Services – until a certain load of resources or monthly quota is reached. Purpose Based – this is a type of limitation that limits the number of records in one instance of the Cloud Services to a certain number or a type (e.g., number of invoices for a month, number of cars, specific type of records etc.). Functionality Based – defines the functional modules or specific functions of the Cloud Services, which are subject to the license. Multiple usage limits may be applied to Customer, based on their Order Form and personal and business needs. 7.2. Bundles Customer or Developer, who has developed an application that integrates and requires a license for the ERP.net Cloud Platform, is not allowed to purchase licenses or act as an intermediary or reseller of such in order to sell them in a Bundle. In case a Customer or a Developer wants to make their application available to other Customers and Users, they can sell it without a license for the ERP.net Cloud Platform thru the official Marketplace or thru their own channels. If a Customer or a Developer wants to offer licenses for the ERP.net Cloud Platform, they can sign a Partnership agreement and be included in the official ERP.net reseller lists. If a Customer or a Developer wants, independently of the ERP.net, to develop apps, and offer them in Bundles with ERP.net Cloud Platform licenses, they should sign a separate Developer agreement. 7.3. Reservation of Rights Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder, ERP.net, its Affiliates and its licensors reserve all of their right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all of their related intellectual property rights. No rights are granted to Customer hereunder other than as expressly set forth herein. 7.4. Ownership of Customer Data As between ERP.net and Customer, all title and intellectual property rights in and to the Customer Data is owned exclusively by Customer. Customer acknowledges and agrees that in connection with the provision of the Services, ERP.net may store and maintain Customer Data for a period of time consistent with ERP.net’s standard business processes for the Services. Following expiration or termination of the Agreement or a Customer account, if applicable, ERP.net may deactivate the applicable Customer and User account(s) and delete any data therein. Customer grants ERP.net the right to host, use, process, display and transmit Customer Data to provide the Services pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Order Form. Customer has sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of Customer Data, and for obtaining all rights related to Customer Data required by ERP.net to perform the Services. 7.5. ERP.net Intellectual Property Rights All rights, title and interest in and to the Services (including without limitation all intellectual property rights therein and all modifications, extensions, customizations, scripts or other derivative works of the Services provided or developed by ERP.net) and anything developed or delivered by or on behalf of ERP.net under this Agreement are owned exclusively by ERP.net or its licensors. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights granted to Customer do not convey any rights in the Services, express or implied, or ownership in the Services or any intellectual property rights thereto. Any rights in the Services or ERP.net’s intellectual property not expressly granted herein by ERP.net are reserved by ERP.net. 7.6. Suggestions/Feedback Customer grants ERP.net and its Affiliates a royalty free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable right to use, modify, distribute and incorporate into the Services (without attribution of any kind) any suggestions, enhancement request, recommendations, proposals, correction or other feedback or information provided by Customer or any Users related to the operation or functionality of the Services or its Affiliates’ services. 7.7. Trademark Except where noticed otherwise in writing, each party grants the other a non-transferable, non-exclusive, royalty free, worldwide license to reproduce and display the other party’s name, logos and trademarks, solely for the purpose of referring to the other party as a customer or supplier, on websites, press releases and other marketing materials. 8. Privacy and Information 8.1. Confidentiality 8.1.1. Definition of Confidential Information “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information of Customer includes Customer Data; Confidential Information of ERP.net includes the Services and the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Order Forms (including pricing). Confidential Information of each party includes business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by such party. 8.1.2. Exceptions Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the non-disclosure obligations set forth in this “Confidentiality” section apply to Confidential Information exchanged between the parties in connection with the evaluation of additional ERP.net services. 8.1.3. Protection of Confidential Information As between the parties, each party retains all ownership rights in and to its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care). Each party agrees not to disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to any third party other than as set forth in the following sentence for a period of five years from the date of the disclosing party’s disclosure of the Confidential Information to the receiving party; however, ERP.net will protect the confidentiality of Customer Data residing in the Cloud Service for as long as such information resides in the Cloud Service. Each party may disclose Confidential Information only to those employees, agents or subcontractors who are required to protect it against unauthorized disclosure in a manner no less protective than required under this Agreement, and each party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information in any legal proceeding or to a governmental entity as required by law. ERP.net will protect the confidentiality of Customer Data residing in the Services in accordance with the ERP.net security practices applicable to Customer’s Order Form as described in this Agreement or such Order Form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ERP.net may disclose the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Order Form to a subcontractor or Third-party Developer to the extent necessary to perform ERP.net’s obligations under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective as set forth herein. 8.1.4. Compelled Disclosure The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information. 8.1.5. Publicity Neither party will use the name of the other party in publicity activities without the prior written consent of the other, except that Customer agrees that ERP.net may use Customer's name in customer listings or quarterly calls with its investors or, at times mutually agreeable to the parties, as part of ERP.net's marketing efforts (including reference calls and stories, press testimonials, site visits). Customer agrees that ERP.net may share information on Customer with its Affiliates for marketing and other business purposes and that it has secured appropriate authorizations to share Customer employee contact information with ERP.net. 8.1.6. Return of Information Upon written request, Customer will promptly return or destroy (and certify such destruction in writing) all Confidential Information in its possession. 8.2. Data protection 8.2.1. Protection of Customer Data ERP.net will maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Customer Data, as described in the Documentation. Those safeguards will include, but will not be limited to, measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of Customer Data (other than by Customer or Users). Except with respect to a free trial, the terms of the data processing addendum at Privacy and DPA page are hereby incorporated by reference and shall apply to the extent Customer Data includes Personal Data, as defined in the DPA. To the extent Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom and Switzerland are processed by us, ERP.net will not transfer personal data outside of EU, except in cases where that was explicitly demanded by the Customer or where it’s strictly necessary for the performance of the Service. In case of a data transfer outside of EEA in case there’s no Adequacy decision under art. 45 GDPR for this country/territory, the Customer agrees to a Standard Contractual Clauses, where Customer and its applicable Affiliates are each the data exporter, and Customer's acceptance of this Agreement, and an applicable Affiliate's execution of an Order Form, shall be treated as its execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses and Appendices. 8.2.2. Processing of Personal Data The parties acknowledge that the Customer’s database may contain Personal Data, for which the Customer is the Controller. This data will be processed by ERP.net the Customer instructs so, or if the Customer transfers their database or a part of their database to ERP.net for any reason pertaining to this Agreement. This processing will be performed in conformance with Data Protection Legislation. In particular, ERP.net commits to: only process the Personal Data when and as instructed by the Customer, and for the purpose of performing one of the Services under this Agreement, unless required by law to do so, in which case ERP.net will provide prior notice to the Customer, unless the law forbids it; ensure that all persons within ERP.net authorised to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality; implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, theft, alteration or disclosure; forward promptly to the Customer any Data Protection request that was submitted to ERP.net with regard to the Customer’s database; notify the Customer promptly upon becoming aware of and confirming any accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful processing of, disclosure of, or access to the Personal Data; notify the Customer if the processing instructions infringe applicable Data Protection Legislation, in the opinion of ERP.net; make available to the Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the Data Protection Legislation, allow for and contribute reasonably to audits, including inspections, conducted or mandated by the Customer; Customer agrees to provide ERP.net with accurate contact information at all times, as necessary to notify the Customer’s Data Protection responsible. 8.2.3. Subprocessors The Customer acknowledges and agrees that in order to provide the Services, ERP.net may use third-party service providers (Subprocessors) to process Personal Data. ERP.net commits to only use Subprocessors in compliance with Data Protection Legislation. This use will be covered by a contract between ERP.net and the Subprocessor that provides guarantees to that effect. 8.2.4. Transmission of Data Customer understands that the technical processing and transmission of Customer’s Electronic Communications is fundamentally necessary to use of the Cloud Service. Customer is responsible for cable or another Internet connection and up to date “browser” software in order to utilize the Cloud Service. Customer expressly consents to ERP.net’s interception and storage of Electronic Communications and/or Customer Data as needed to provide the Services hereunder, and Customer acknowledges and understands that Customer’s Electronic Communications will involve transmission over the Internet, and over various networks, only part of which may be owned and/or operated by ERP.net. Customer further acknowledges and understands that Electronic Communications may be accessed by unauthorized parties when communicated across the Internet, network communications facilities, telephone or other electronic means. Without limiting ERP.net’s applicable obligations under this Agreement, ERP.net is not responsible for any Electronic Communications and/or Customer Data which are delayed, lost, altered, intercepted or stored during the transmission of any data whatsoever across networks not owned and/or operated by ERP.net, including, but not limited to, the Internet and Customer’s local network. 8.2.5. Access to Customer Data Upon request by Customer made within 30 days after the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, ERP.net will make Customer Data available to Customer for export or download as provided in the Documentation. After such 30-day period, ERP.net will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Data, and as provided in the Documentation will thereafter delete or destroy all copies of Customer Data in its systems or otherwise in its possession or control, unless legally prohibited. During the Agreement Term, Customer can access its Customer Data at any time. Customer may export and retrieve its Customer Data in a standard format. Export and retrieval may be subject to technical limitations, in which case ERP.net and Customer will find a reasonable method to allow Customer access to Customer Data. Before the Agreement Term expires, Customer may use ERP.net’s API (Application Programming Interface) endpoint to perform a final export of Customer Data from the Cloud Service. In the event of third-party legal proceedings relating to the Customer Data, ERP.net will cooperate with Customer and comply with applicable law (both at Customer’s expense) with respect to handling of the Customer Data. 9. Invoices and Payment 9.1. Billing Models Billing Models are different approaches for pricing and charging a Customer based on their needs, use of the Services, and purchased licenses. ERP.net offers three types of Billing Models for their Customers. Billing Models are applied to the different Usage limits (see Section 7.1.1). Depending on the details specified in the Order Form one Billing Model can be applied to all Usage limits or different Billing Models can be chosen for specific Usage limits. 9.1.1. Types of Billing Models Subscription Billing Model – You commit in advance to purchase a specific quantity of Services for use during the Agreement Term and to pay upfront or on a periodic basis in advance of use. Committed quantities not used during the month will expire at the end of it. Usage Billing Models (Pay-As-You-Go) – You pay based on actual usage in the preceding month with no upfront commitment. Payment is on a periodic basis specified in the Order Form. Combined billing model (Pay-As-You-Grow) – This model combines the above two and it’s applies exceptionally to certain usage limits. Customer commits to specific quantity, which is paid upfront every month (Subscription Model). In case the Customer's needs exceed this quantity, they are charged based on certain unit of cost (Usage Model). In the begging of each month Customer is billed for all over-usage from the past month and the applicable fee for the next. 9.1.2. Pre-set restrictions With respect to ERP.net Cloud Services, when Customer has chosen the Subscription Billing Model for a specific Usage limit, all additional or other usage (for example, usage beyond Customer’s commitment quantity) may be transformed to a Combined Billing Model for that particular period of over usage or for the remaining of the Agreement Term. ERP.net will try to notify Customer and the Administrator before such transformation occurs. 9.1.3. Default Billing Model Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Order Form or Documentation, the Subscription Billing Model should apply to the Purchased Services and their Usage limits for the Agreement Term stated in the applicable Order Form or in the applicable online purchasing portal. Customer can make a request for different combinations of Usage limits and Billing Models, but ERP.net reserves the right to prepare a personal offer that may better meet the needs of the Customer. 9.2. Agreement Term Regardless of the date on which the Order Form is submitted, the Agreement Term starts only on the 1st of the month. All days during which the Service was used in the first month are credited to the invoice for the next full month of using the Services. This Agreement is valid for the Order Forms which this Agreement accompanies. The Agreement Term for all Purchased Services shall be as specified in the applicable Order Form. 9.3. Pricing and Payment Customer will provide ERP.net with valid and updated bank card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to ERP.net. If Customer provides bank card (credit card, debit card, virtual card etc.) information to ERP.net, Customer authorizes ERP.net to charge such bank card for all Purchased Services listed in the Order Form for the initial Agreement Term and any renewal Agreement Term(s). Such charges shall be made either monthly or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in Order Form. In case of monthly billing and based on the Billing Models chosen, such charges will be made: In case of Subscription Billing Model – on the 1st for the advance use for next month; In case of Usage Billing Models – on the 1st for the use generated for the previous month; In case of Combined billing model – on the 1st for the advanced and used quantities; If the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method other than a bank card, ERP.net will invoice Customer in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, invoiced fees are due net 15 days from the invoice date. Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to ERP.net and notifying ERP.net of any changes to such information. Customer agrees that its purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by ERP.net regarding future functionality or features. 9.4. Renewal Except as otherwise specified in an Order Form, the Agreement Term will automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Agreement Term or one year (whichever is shorter), unless either party gives the other written notice (email acceptable) at least 30 days before the end of the relevant Agreement Term. Except as expressly provided in the applicable Order Form, renewal of promotional or one-time prices will be at ERP.net’s applicable list price in effect at the time of the applicable renewal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any renewal in which Purchased Services volume or Agreement Term length for any Services has decreased from the prior term will result in re-pricing at renewal without regard to the prior term’s per-unit pricing. 9.5. Price Changes Prices are subject to change to the prices in effect at the start of a new Agreement Term either by submitting Order Form or by automatic renewal under section 9.4. ERP.net reserves the right to make any corrections to prices quoted due to clerical errors or errors of omission. In the event of any specific requirements (including without limitation specification, ordered quantity, or increased usage) representing a price increase, Customer will be notified and afforded an opportunity, within 7 days, to renounce the price changes, or to disputes them according to the rules of section 9.8.1. In an event, that Customer fails to renounce the price increase in the given timespan, they will be billed automatically, based on the higher rate, for the duration of the Agreement Term. 9.6. No Refunds All amounts are non-refundable, non-cancellable and non-creditable. You agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable. 9.7. Overdue Charges If any invoiced amount is not received by ERP.net by the due date, then without limiting ERP.net’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) ERP.net may condition future renewals and Order Forms on payment terms, shorter than those specified in this section. 9.8. Suspension of Service and Acceleration If any charge owing by Customer under this or any other Agreement for Services is 30 days or more overdue, (or 10 or more days overdue in the case of amounts Customer has authorized ERP.net to charge to Customer’s bank card), ERP.net may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee obligations under such Agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until such amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for Customers paying by credit card or direct debit whose payment has been declined, ERP.net will give Customer at least 10 days prior notice that its account is overdue before suspending services to Customer. 9.8.1. Payment Disputes ERP.net will not exercise its rights in the sections above if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. 9.9. Fees Customer will pay all Fees specified in Order Forms. Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, (i) Fees are based on Purchased Services and the chosen Billing Models, (ii) payment obligations are non-cancellable and Fees paid are non-refundable, and (iii) when applicable, quantities purchased cannot be decreased during the relevant Agreement Term. Customer will pay the Fees applicable to the Purchased Services and the Billing Models (“License Fees”) and any other Fees, including but not limited to Fees relating to currency conversion, bank charges, transfer charges and any related payment transaction charges (“Transaction Fees”), and any Fees relating to your purchase or use of any services such as App, Marketplace purchases, or Third-Party Services (“Additional Fees”). License Fees are paid based on the applicable Billing Models and will be billed in as stated in Section 9.3 – Pricing and Payment. Transaction Fees and Additional Fees will be charged from time to time at ERP.net’s discretion. You will be charged on each Agreement Term for all outstanding Fees that have not previously been charged. Fees will appear on an invoice, which will be sent to the Customer and Administrator. 9.10. Resellers If you make any purchases through an authorized partner or reseller of ERP.net (“Reseller”), instead of paying ERP.net, you will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between you and the Reseller. We may suspend or terminate your rights to use Cloud Services if we do not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller. Your order details (e.g., the Cloud Services you are entitled to use, the number of Users, the Agreement Term, etc.) will be as stated in the Order Form placed with us by the Reseller on your behalf, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order Form as communicated to us. If you are entitled to a refund under this Agreement, then unless we otherwise specify, we will refund any applicable Fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to you. Resellers are not authorized to modify this Agreement or make any promises or commitments on our behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth. The amount paid or payable by the Reseller to us for your use of the applicable Cloud Services under this Agreement will be deemed the amount actually paid or payable by you to us under this Agreement for purposes of calculating the liability cap. 9.11. No contingencies on other products of future functionality You acknowledge that the Cloud Services and Additional Services referenced in an Order Form are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services. Payment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other services (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Services and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Order Form). You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Services beyond the current Agreement Term), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features. 10. Tax Fees and other charges imposed under an Order Form will not include taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”), all of which will be for Customer’s account. Customer is responsible for all taxes, other than ERP.net’s income and payroll taxes. Customer must provide to ERP.net any direct pay permits or valid tax-exempt certificates prior to signing an Order Form. If ERP.net has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, ERP.net will invoice Customer and they will pay that amount unless Customer provides ERP.net with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, ERP.net is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property and employees. 10.1. Withholding Taxes You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes. You and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available. If we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof. You will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted. 11. Termination and Cancellations 11.1. Termination 11.1.1. Termination for Cause Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after notice; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If a Customer terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Section, ERP.net will refund you any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Agreement Term after the effective date of termination. If ERP.net terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Section, Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Agreement Term after the effective date of termination. 11.1.2. Termination for Convenience You may choose to stop using the Cloud Services and terminate this Agreement (including all Order Forms) at any time for any reason upon written notice to us, upon any such termination (i) you will not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees and (ii) if you have not already paid all applicable fees for the then-current Agreement Term or related services period (as applicable), any such fees that are outstanding will become immediately due and payable. 11.2. Consequence of termination Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, you must cease using all Cloud Services and delete (or at our request, return) all Confidential Information or other materials of ours in your possession, including on any third-party systems operated on your behalf. You will certify such deletion upon our request. You will not have access to Your Data (and we may delete all of Your Data unless legally prohibited) after expiration or termination of this Agreement (or its applicable Agreement Term), so you should make sure to export Your Data using the functionality of the Cloud Services during the applicable Agreement Term. In no event will termination relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination. Except where an exclusive remedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise. 11.3. Survival The following provisions will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms: Sections 4.2. (Responsibilities), 4.3 (Security), 5.3 (Responsibility for Users), 6.3 (Third-Party Developers), 7 (Use and restriction of the platform), 8 (Privacy and information), 9.5 (No refunds), 9.6 (Overdue Charges),9.8 (Fees), 12 (Liability and indemnities), 14 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction). 12.
