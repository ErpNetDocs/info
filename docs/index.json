Standard Business Intelligence The standard BI provides standardized cubes, tailored for standard scenarios. This has some pros and cons. The standard BI evolves with each new version of the platform. The problem is that it might not have the custom view required by some custom tailored business processes. Custom Business Intelligence Custom BI utilizes some external BI tool, like Microsoft Power BI . Custom BI has access to the data through API and can be used to build custom cubes, KPIs, dashboards and more. The custom BI can be integrated directly in the system through web views, context filtered by the on-screen data. For example, when you open a customer definition, you can see a BI information right there, tightly integrated with the other master data."
