    "keywords": "ERP.net Data Warehouse The information powerhouse of your organization In the information-dominated business landscape, making use and making sense of accumulated data is becoming core to gaining knowledge and making informed decisions. Organizations are collecting so much data that storing and processing it becomes a significant challenge. It is still a common practice for companies to create numerous spreadsheet tables to handle the data accrued. While most of the spreadsheet tables are great for organizing and sorting data sets and applying basic calculations and formulas, when it comes to storing, controlling, and analyzing vast amounts of data from different sources to support business intelligence, mere tables will not cut it. Even a simple everyday example, such as having multiple versions of the same table saved or edited by different users or accidentally deleting a crucial spreadsheet files or field value can help highlight the need for a more streamlined method of handling and utilizing company data. Organizations need a single source of truth within their ERP system where all data is stored and managed, as opposed to having chunks of information living in disparate tables across systems and users. Enter the ERP.net Data Warehouse module – the digital storage of all your organization’s information. The module collects, connects, and harmonizes data from a number of disparate sources, systems, databases, or even companies. This central repository stores integrated data – both current and historical – and is the key ingredient for business analysis, reporting, and insight. With the Data Warehouse , data from heterogenous and external sources is properly formatted and stored, so that queries and analysis can be easily performed by any BI system to get a current and long-range view of data over time. Business analysts use such information: As the basis of balance scorecards To cut data into dimensions Measure performance over time Benchmark and compare target values and key parameters Combine data from a number of ERP systems and visualize reports within the built-in BI panels of ERP.net navigators Take control of your data Apart from helping analysts make sense of accrued financial, accounting, and performance data, Data Warehouse helps teams enter and operate with everyday data more easily and get a more profound overview of data within their workflows. For example, team members can enter information about sales within a specific time period, even for periods before the ERP system was implemented, or commonplace information, such as visits of sales associates with prospects.

    "keywords": "Accounting Module Module Accounting of ERP.net automates financial and accounting activities. It supports current bookings, closing of accounts, VAT reporting, cash, bank and currency operations, assessment of inventories and accounting for claims and liabilities. Accounting information can be integrated and presented visually in other modules of the ERP system, and together with subsystem Finance financial and accounting management align more closely. Integration Module Accounting is fully integrated with the main system and changes in other modules are automatically reflected in the accounting records. This eliminates double data entry, saving time and costs. Automation The module automates various processes, such as creating accounting entries and all document types, currency revaluation, calculation of depreciation of assets, revaluation of receivables from customers and payables to suppliers, and finalization of accounts. With the module, economic transactions are accounted for under preset templates. Accounting templates are a mechanism to indicate the system how to account for primary documents. They also allow you to define common operations in order to facilitate and accelerate entering accounting information. The creation of an accounting template requires setting a sequence of operations. In each operation, it is defined where to take a sum from and which account to put it in. Accounting templates are a very important tool to achieve maximum automation of labor. After the initial setup by an accountant, they allow you to distribute the tasks for entering primary data between accountants and people performing business transactions. The module also allows adding dimensions in one account, modeling dimensions and automatic accounting operations, and connecting dimensions with data from operational documents. In addition, you can use it to make references by dimensions and combine them. Individual chart of accounts Module Accounting allows the creation of an individual chart of accounts. It has a tree structure, which allows you to quickly and easily find an account or a group of accounts. You can define accounts and groups of accounts specific to your company, and to track them and keep accounts by various criteria. A wide range of statements and reports The module provides a wide range of operational reports and financial statements and allows tracking of every accounting transaction. This facilitates the analysis of financial results and making management decisions. Categorisation of revenue and expenditure In module Accounting, you can enter and use the centers of revenue and expenditure to categorize income and expenses for accounting and management purposes by departments. Costs can be associated with revenue both manually and on a predetermined proportion, and information from reports can be visualized as a summary or in detail. Simultaneous tax and management accounting Keeping tax and management accounts simultaneously is not an easy task because these two types of accounting need to answer different questions. They treats costs in different ways. ERP.net allows you to use two charts of accounts simultaneously when entering primary accounting documents. Thus, as early as during the implementation of the system, you can set a management breakdown of costs and your own requirements for data visualization without interfering with accounting or tax requirements and regulations. This way the management will be able to get the necessary financial and accounting information without help from the accounting department. Attaching documents to accounting ERP.net also allows you to attach invoices, payment orders and other primary documents to accounting. This saves time in searching for information in the archives and allows the management to make quick references on the details of accounting documents. This functionality is especially useful when performing accounting and internal company audits."

    "keywords": "Excise Management module Overview The production and distribution of alcohol products is an exciting and dynamic market . As a specialized industry, it comes with many distinct challenges. Aside from the various challenges typically met in the production and distribution sectors, companies dealing with alcohol products face branch-specific challenges . Some of the most notable of these are related to complying with regulations and reporting to authorities . Unlike many other business fields, the production and distribution of alcohol are strictly regulated . Authorities like state institutions and international regulatory agencies mandate businesses to meticulously prepare , store , and present documentation about their operations with alcoholic materials and goods. This means a huge number of processes and sets of data, emerging from them, have to be tracked, recorded, and processed . In addition, businesses must regularly create and finalize documents observing rigorous rules and laws, and report these documents to the excise tax authorities . Learn how ERP.net's Excise Management module can assist you in smoothly overcoming all these challenges. The module is designed to facilitate data collection, processing, and management in order to help you with reporting to authorities . Using Excise module of ERP.net takes a lot of effort off your business and helps you ensure it remains in compliance with the active legislation. Experience and functionality in one Alcohol beverages are most often than not subject to excise tax. Companies producing and selling alcoholic beverages must keep documentation in accordance with long lists of codes, purposes, operations, and categories of products that fall under excise tax laws. State requirements are easier to comply with when your business has a solution that encompasses the necessary functionality under one roof . ERP.net combines years of experience, development, and best practices built into it. The platform offers all the necessary means for your company to reduce the efforts on operating and documenting the materials, goods, and processes used in the production and trade of alcohol. The Excise module of ERP.net enables you to create and manage administrative documentation about raw materials for alcoholic products, semi-finished goods, and finished products. Managing excise products in ERP.net Due to the rigorous regulations applied to them, excise products cannot be stored in ordinary stores and warehouses, alongside other random products. These products are kept in a special type of store, called a tax warehouse . The Tax Warehouse functionality in ERP.net allows you to assign a physical store or a group of stores as a tax warehouse, that is designated especially for the movement and storage of excise-taxed products. Note Some alcohol products are taxed with zero-rate excise duty. Producers and distributors do not pay excise tax on these products when they release them from the tax warehouse. Nevertheless, these alcohol products are still subject to the same laws and regulations, and as such, are required to be present in administrative documentation for excise tax authorities. Depending on the specific countries they are located in, tax warehouses can be required to operate with measuring devices installed on each of the entry and exit points . These devices record each alcohol item's parameters (such as quantity, alcohol proof, time of transaction, etc.) when coming in or going out of the store. ERP.net enables you to save the devices and the transactions recorded by them within the system to incorporate them in the regular reports. The Excise module gives you the opportunity to organize your excise products with respect to their codes , purposes , categories , duty rates , and other crucial attributes mandatory for creating administrative documentation. Excise stamp operations and lots Alcohol products that are charged with excise tax are required to be affixed with an excise stamp designated for every particular product . ERP.net features functionality for tracking and managing stamp lots and stamp operations for excise products. The system helps you trace the usage of stamp lots and the operations they went under for each excise product , tax warehouse , and enterprise company . This information is grouped, summarized, and included in the periodic reports. Native integration within ERP.net The native integration of ERP.net allows you to use your nomenclatures and records already present in other modules of the system. Your business can benefit from this in multiple ways: Save time by eliminating the need for repeated manual data entry Eliminate waiting time by wiping out the need to periodically synchronize data with external systems Reduce the risk of error drastically using already present records for new documents Reduce time and resource consumption by automating menial tasks in creating and finalizing reports for exporting The built-in reporting capabilities of ERP.net's Excise Management module make it extremely easy for your business to report to excise tax authorities. Excise Management in ERP.net gives you an opportunity to share the complete excise data reports with regulatory institutions via an integrated, secure legislative web app. By granting excise tax institutions access to this web app, authorities are able to visit it as a website and export the excise reports they require from your company in a single step. This reduces your efforts on data exchange and greatly eases off communication with the respective authorities in your region. Utilizing the Excise Management module in ERP.net helps your company stay competitive and trouble-free when managing and selling your alcohol products in a confident, cost-effective way . Documentation and Reporting ERP.net helps you create and handle all necessary administrative documents and excise declarations to facilitate excise tax and product data reporting. Using the Excise module, you can generate documents required from your business: Electronic Administrative Documentation (e-AD) Excise Declarations Excise Stamp Operations Note Thanks to the flexible and adaptive nature of ERP.net, the Excise module can be fine-tuned to help your company meet the legislative requirements with regard to the country it operates in and the laws acting in that country.

    "keywords": "File Manager of ERP.net Overview Oftentimes, keeping files in an external storage (like local drives or cloud platforms) leads to searching through complex external directories to find a file you are looking for. And this often leaves a gap between navigating through internal ERP entities and external file storage. File Management inside the ERP system is a feasible and productive way to close this gap and utilize the ERP system's full potential . Some files are associated with a specific record in the ERP system. They are an integral part of the record and make more sense if stored attached to it. To meet these needs, your ERP.net system provides you with the universal functionality of attaching embedded or linked files to an internal record or other object , available throughout all subsystems. Other files are more generic documents for business use , such as documentation regarding training courses, internal or external regulations, company practices, handbooks, and so on. These concern the organization as a whole and are used for general reference or as informational sources . In this case, being able to upload them in an accessible storage, unattached , would be a more suitable solution. To solve this, ERP.net now comes with the updated functionality File Management v2.0 . Built upon the proven and trusted functionality of attaching documents to specific objects , File Manager of ERP.net now extends its abilities featuring a way to also store an unattached file . File Manager enables you to store and access your files and folders in an organized and straightforward way. Its intuitive structure resembles the well-known Windows File Explorer structure users are used to. The new functionality for organizing your work files and folders is accessible to all users of your ERP.net platform regardless of their workplace's physical location. File Manager Structure File Management v2.0 unlocks new opportunities by providing a uniform, centralized and shared structure for managing your business documentation in a cloud environment, integrated with the rest of your data within the ERP platform. ERP.net's File Manager uses a vertically-expandable hierarchical tree structure to arrange and represent your folders. The File tree can be expanded or collapsed to list or hide subfolders for a more detailed , or conversely, a more compact layout. You can use the folder tree to easily view your folders and navigate throughout your directories structure . In the Folder tree you can also: Edit the definition (name, parent, and notes) of the selected folder. Create a new folder Change the name of the selected folder Remove the selected folder from the folder tree and your storage Refresh the contents of the folder tree The Files window shows the files stored in the selected folder. It also allows to: Open the selected file using an appropriate application Save the selected file to your local storage or external storage Delete the selected file(s) Upload new file(s) to your ERP.net File Manager storage File Manager Views The layout options for visualizing your files are identical to the popular ones in Windows File Explorer. Different layouts represent a different level of density and details for the files in the current folder. There are currently eight available views for viewing your documents. You can choose between different icon sizes, tiles, list, details, and other. File Manager Sections While in Details layout , you can assign sections to your files. Sections will be shown in all other layouts . Each section is represented by its name and a horizontal line , separating it from other sections. This way the systems groups all of your files belonging to the same section. By using sections, you can organize your files in a neat and convenient for you way to navigate visually throughout them even faster. Uploading Files to Your File Manager Storage You can store all types of files in your ERP.net File Manager Storage . You can even select multiple files for upload and then upload them all at once . Files can be uploaded and stored in your ERP.net storage using one of the available three storage methods : Embedded file - your file's full contents are uploaded to your ERP.net storage Linked file - allows you to create a shortcut linked to the physical location of the file (a physical drive with shared access, or its shared partition or folder) Internet URL - create a shortcut linked to an object located on the Internet using a URL (for example, a shortcut to a website opened by your browser) The Embedded file option is best suitable for small-sized file that are frequently used by your ERP.net instance's users. Linked file is a solution suitable for larger-sized files located on a shared resource accessible to your users, saving space on your ERP.net database. And Internet URL is a great option for working with very large-sized files which are located on your external cloud storage , as well as accessing resources readily available on the Internet . Opening and Editing Your Files with Your File Manager You can open and edit your files directly in ERP.net File Manager using a suitable application on your computer for each file type. File Manager Extensivity You can do so much more with File Manager without leaving your ERP.net environment : Open and edit your files - do it directly via File Manager . All changes to the file are saved immediately into the database where the file is located, as soon as you save the file. Feel free to close your file afterwards or continue editing. Add quick notes to your files - these serve as a brief explanation or comments to the file. The notes are added and shown in the Tiles , Contents , and Details layouts, next to your file's icon and name. Filter your files - set one or more filters to exclude from showing files that may be irrelevant to your current activities. Files can be filtered by various kinds of criteria, for example: file extension, type, symbols contained in the file name, date and time, etc. Search your file storage - use the main search bar to find the file you are looking for. Use the full file name or just a part of the file name . Set access restrictions for different users - limit access to your folders and files for various users."

Warehouse entrance and exit control The module provides a single point of receipt of warehouse orders, whose execution is controlled by barcode readers. The control covers both revenue and expenditure warehouse operations to ensure up to date information on stocks. The verification process by barcode readers is carried out after products have already been collected and moved to the checking place. An employee opens a special form in the system designed for implementation monitoring. The data in the form is filtered by order number or addressee. Then the product check with a barcode reader begins. Timely warning The module can find discrepancies between a scanned item and the documented information about it. It automatically triggers an audible and visual alarm. If there is an attempt to register an amount which is larger than the actual order, the system displays an error message accompanied by an audible signal. In case the registered amount is lower than the order, the corresponding line turns red so that it gets checked by an employee who can see if this is a mistake or the product is not available. After verification, the module automatically generates a warehouse receipt for the amount, which is a signal to check out the goods from the warehouse. Facilities at work To avoid the need to use a keyboard, there is an option for the printed orders to feature a barcode for the document number. An additional convenience is the option to print out a list of barcodes for different amounts that can be scanned when an order includes several identical items. For example, an employee first scans the barcode of “10x” from the list and then the product itself. The aim is to avoid repeated scanning of products which are the same."

Since these components comprise the final distributed and sold product, their full set is treated as a single product and must be managed accordingly. ERP.net fully supports the Composite Products feature to meet all needs and help overcome all challenges when dealing with composite products. Examples of Composite Products The furniture manufacturing and distribution businesses are just some key examples of industries that rely heavily on composite products to run their operations. Furniture and fixture items are typical products which require an ERP-CRM system that is fully capable of defining , managing , and selling such products. Many other businesses, like those trading desktop and server configurations, HVAC (heat, ventilation, and air conditioning), and windows and doors mechanisms and systems, necessitate proper business management solutions and strategies just as much. Implementing Composite Products into ERP.net WMS The Warehouse Management System of ERP.net provides complete and integrated support for handling and managing composite products. The system provides all necessary means to fulfill all kinds of orders and tasks associated with handling and managing composite products , accompanied by their related documentation . WMS is capable of breaking down requisitions for composite products to generate new orders for executing operations with their components. Availabilities for all components of composite products can be tracked in real-time by the help of the built-in Warehouse Availabilities Report functionality. Levels of Control for Composite Products in WMS of ERP.net WMS introduces several levels of control which can be set for proper and controlled task execution when working with composite products: Level 50 - Check all This is the highest and therefore the most restrictive level. Requires all products to be scanned or entered by product code for every piece. The component products and product quantities must exactly match those in the composite product's definition, otherwise the system prevents order fulfillment. Level 40 - Check all + Allow incomplete finish Same as level 50, but the application provides an option to still fulfill the order even when they do not match. Level 30 - Just preview totals The mobile app displays a summarized view of all products and quantities for the selected order, available for counting or checking, and does not require scanning or entering by product code. Level 20 - Check and complete The system checks if the whole order execution exactly matches the composite product's definition when a kit/dekit execution is attempted. A warning is shown when differences are detected, and the check is unsuccessful. Level 10 - Autocomplete The system automatically executes the kit/dekit operation if all component lines are fulfilled and exactly match the composite product's definition. During fulfillment, these levels of control define the rules and allowances which the worker is facing to carry out the job. Various levels of control result in different restrictions to how orders in the WMS Worker mobile app may be carried out. This methodology mitigates the risks of human errors prior to shipping."

Shops and retail stores, functioning as standalone stores or retail chains, are examples of places that perform basic storage manipulations . These are usually replenishing stocks , counting available articles , and issuing sold products from the inventory. Introduced in v.2024, ERP.net brings the Inventory Control mobile app - the solution enabling you and your staff to execute all these regular operations in your platform quickly and efficiently . Running a more productive store The basic actions associated with the inventory of your store may be relatively simple, but these occupy a significant part of your employees' workday . Retail stores and other simplified storage spaces go through three basic processes with their stock: Receiving goods from suppliers or from other stores Issuing goods that are sold to customers or moved to other stores Counting stock in the storage area and on the shelves These processes are an essential part of your shop or retail business. But their repetitive nature can be tiring and time-consuming. Cutting down on the time spent doing these leaves more time for other important and productive activities. Implementing a solution that helps with menial operations is a way to achieve this. Inventory Control streamlines these processes and lets your team focus on serving your customers and consulting them on their needs . As a result, your crew is able to direct their efforts at increasing the quality of your services . The proper solution supporting your store is an investment that immediately starts to pay off, as keeping your customers happy and loyal drives more sales to your retail business. Boost your performance with Inventory Control Your business can benefit from utilizing the Inventory Control app in several ways: Reducing the time needed for executing your basic operations by guiding your staff step by step through them Minimizing the risk of errors by navigating employees through the job in a clear and straightforward way Ensuring a proper match between your store's physically available stock and your system records Inventory Control operates within the Inventory Management System of ERP.net as part of the Advanced Logistics package. This can facilitate your inventory management and automatically update your records for accounting and company purposes accordingly. Speed and control Inventory Control app is all about speed and simplicity of use. The application fully supports barcode control and is designed especially for fast data entry via scanning. To fully live to its purpose, it is built to run extensively on mobile devices. By rapid scanning of series of barcodes , your store employees can accelerate the tedious process of manual data entry. Even more, they can turn each step of line entry into a split-second, single-button click for whole stacks of products. Inventory Control allows scanning of not only product barcodes but also barcodes containing the quantity of the next product scanned. Bringing up the built-in report of frequently used quantities allows you to view and print barcodes that represent these. Use quantity barcodes to speed up your work tremendously - print them and stick them conveniently in your work area (on a wall, rack, or desk) where you process goods. Tip When your store receives, sells, or counts 100 chocolates or 50 packs of coffee all at once, your staff needs to scan just 2 barcodes. Just scan the appropriate quantity barcode (50 or 100) and the app will load and apply this quantity to your next scanned product. Then, scan the product - and you are done. This way your employees can carry out operations faster than ever and minimize the possibilities of manually made errors, all at the same time. This applies to all operations supported by the app. Designed to your needs The Inventory Control application puts the focus on its users to bring maximum results for your business.

    "title": "Projected Available Balance | ERP.net Information",
    "keywords": "Projected Available Balance Overview Every business selling physical goods, regardless of their exact industry sector, operates an inventory which is comprised of itemized products and their quantities meant for sale to customers. And customers, be it individuals or other companies , normally expect their ordered goods to be shipped within some reasonable period . Knowing your exact current product quantities is largely important for everyday operations and is also the foundation for any future inventory planning . To keep meeting your customers’ expectations in the long run, as well as to minimize downtime due to lack of supplies for the business's own operation, a useful approach is to define and follow a clear inventory management strategy. For achieving that, however, you must first learn to review, prepare, and organize your inventory beyond its current availability . This is done by implementing and utilizing what is called Projected available balance or PAB . Projected available balance is an important concept in inventory management. It represents the inventory balance (product quantities) that is projected (planned to have) into the future and is expected to be available on hand when the respective time comes. The Challenge of Perceptive and Lean Inventory Management Inventory keeping is the foundation for any business trading goods and it comes with the related expenditures. This means balance between supplies and sales is the one characteristic that gets the say when planning the inventory, as it largely affects how competitive and profitable the organization gets to be. An efficient business model steers clear from maintaining large amounts of products in any store or warehouse, as this can rapidly bump up space requirements, hinder management and maintenance, and open many risks for the staff and the business. The prohibitive costs originating from keeping such inventory amounts make sense for businesses to order new supplies intelligently , avoiding hoarding of stock that may become unsaleable with time (also known as dead stock), especially if it could quickly expire or become outdated morally, technologically, or otherwise. Typical examples for dead stock can be found in most industries, such as: in the food manufacturing and distribution with many preservative-free food products , which can expire in just a few days or weeks in the fashion industry , where clothes do not expire by perishing but rather by falling out of fashion , therefore drifting away from market demand in IT products retail , where products not sold within a few years are already having discontinued support and are superseded by new more modern products. A visionary management never skimps on replenishments too, on the other hand, in order to stay away from falling short of supplies right when customers are inquiring or determined to place an order . Those customers who have already placed orders with a company remain a number one priority for allocation and expense of the available product quantities, as your business has already made promises which must be kept , for the level of customer satisfaction can vastly impact the company's reputation among its audience. Avoiding going to any of these two extremes helps to protect your business from delivery problems, reputation damage, and profit evaporation. Achieving this balance means always keeping the right amounts of products in stock, no more, no less. Successful inventory management is a sophisticated process that requires an insightful approach with an eye to the future . What Exactly Is Projected Available Balance? Projected available balance is basically a listing of your planned product amounts that are calculated for one or more future periods and are expected to be on-hand at that time , respectively. These amounts are called projected because they are estimated into the future and are planned to be on site in the store or warehouse. Note Many factors can affect the actual availability when the time comes, as delays in supplies, problems with transportation and receiving stock, customer orders cancellation, as well as other random accidents throughout the supply chain exert their influence on the real product quantities that truly get to be on hand . This, however, does not make the whole concept of PAB pointless, rather outlines even further the importance of understanding it to make practical and foresighted decisions , making your business more resilient when recovering from any accidents that may happen, and also staying more flexible and productive when serving customers. The reason PAB is so essential is the fact it is used for several critical inventory operations, such as calculating the Available to promise product quantities your business can offer, releasing Master Production Schedule (MPS) , making proper decisions when the need for restocking arises, balancing out the manufacturing, warehouse, and delivery loads, and many others. How to Find out Projected Available Balance PAB is derived from the current inventory balance by subtracting planned outbound store orders and adding scheduled receipts of supplies . It is a running sum that starts from the current values and is iteratively calculated for all consecutive future periods until calculations reach the desired period . The general formula for calculating PAB is as follows: PAB sum = PI + RS - SO where: PAB sum is Projected Available Balance listing PI is currently present inventory RS are Scheduled receipts of supplies SO are planned outbound store orders (for intrastore movement or customer delivery) all of which apply for a single given product . Note Projected available balance should NOT be mistaken for Available to promise inventory quantities. Projected available balance represents the full inventory amount that is expected to be physically at hand for any successive future period. Available to promise shows only this inventory portion that remains physically available to offer for sale and delivery , aside from fulfilling already placed customer orders or serving the company's own necessities. Although close in meaning and related in implementation, the two terms still express different concepts. PAB Example Suppose we run a company that trades hand tools and power tools. Let us take some product, for example, a cordless drill driver . We will take a look at how its quantity is projected over the course of a week . For each day we have a number of planned orders , and respectively, expect to receive a number of supplies for this product. We start with an initial inventory quantity of 30 drills . This quantity is also the projected available balance right now, as it matches the present. Using the above-mentioned formula, we can calculate the number of cordless drivers we expect to have at hand on each subsequent day, shown in the last column: Day Orders Supplies PAB Starting N/A N/A 30 1 22 11 19 2 25 18 12 3 17 27 22 4 0 20 42 5 39 0 3 6 0 0 3 7 10 35 28 Note Projected available balance can be a positive , zero , or negative number , depending on the planned orders and s cheduled receipts . For successfully managing your store, you must make sure you enter each consequent time period with an inventory that is suited to the market demand. This means the sum of the projected available balance for the current period and the scheduled supplies for the current period must at least match the outbound orders for the next period . You can find more information on how PAB is calculated in ERP.net on the following document: Projected Available Balance - Technical Documentation Why PAB Matters in Your Business Projected available balance is a powerful inventory management tool that can help you gain better insight into your inventory. Understanding it can help you make smarter decisions when replenishing and spending up your inventory. Utilizing projected available balance and coming up with a solid inventory management strategy allows your business to keep its promises to customers while avoiding overstocking or underdelivering . PAB implementation into ERP.net Projected available balance is deeply integrated into ERP.net's Logistics subsystem. PAB functionality in ERP.net, similarly ATP, operates in real time , so your business can always receive the latest and most up to date inventory data . If any new orders are planned or supplies are scheduled, they will immediately take effect on PAB and ATP quantities and reports. This way you can always stay tuned with your inventory movements and know what promises to make to your partners, customers, and other parties. Benefits of Understanding and Utilizing PAB Concept By mastering Projected available balance and utilizing it via your ERP.net platform, your business can go a long way towards: Preventing accumulation of dead stock or stock shortages Increasing the efficiency of inventory operations Reducing accumulation of outdated or waste materials and damaged goods in the warehouse Enhancing the general view of the inventory Lightening and redistributing the load on equipment, people, and others.

    "title": "Catch Weight Products | ERP.net Information",
    "keywords": "Catch Weight Products Overview Some industries trade products (like meat, potatoes, cheese, iron bars, fuel, and others), the quantity of which may vary to some degree for each individual piece of the product that is bought, processed, and sold. The quantity deviations from the nominal quantity may be caused by various reasons . Natural biological processes (for example, weight loss of dried foods), manufacturing specifics or inaccuracies (arranging pieces of the product in packages of larger units), or other processes and characteristics that are immutable by anyone. Such products are traded by utilizing what is called Variable Measurement Ratios - a unique characteristic accounting for the difference between the exactly measured quantity of any single item and the nominal or average quantity which the product is assigned for selling. Catch Weight , as the term is widely known, is the most commonly met case of variable measurement ratios. It concerns products with varying weight and represents the actual measured (\"caught\") weight of any individual product item as opposed to the nominal weight for this product (hence the term \"Catch Weight\"). ERP.net has got a detailed and specialized solution for your industry operating with Catch Weight or any other Variable Measurement Ratio products. Note Catch Weight is just one variation of Variable Measurement Ratios available in our business management solution. ERP.net fully supports all kinds of units of measurement by which the product is accounted for and the quantity may vary. Examples Many products are bought and accounted for in one unit of measurement (e.g., \"lbs.\" or \"kgs\"), processed (for example, dosed or arranged in packages), and later sold and accounted for in other unit of measure (e.g., \"pcs.\" or \"packs\"). Other products experience changes in weight through time. The following examples may provide more clarity on dynamic measurement ratios: A company buys potatoes in bulk from farms, accounting for them in lbs. or kgs . The packaging department then doses the potatoes in net bags, each of which has the same nominal weight. The company then proceeds to sell the net bags to retail stores, accounting for the sold net bags in pcs . Since it is not practically achievable for every bag to weight exactly the same, even more, have the exact nominal weight value, every bag's weight differs from the rest and deviates slightly from the nominal. This leads to differences in the accounting records between the full purchased quantity in bulk, and the full sold quantity in pieces, when converted and counted in the same unit of measurement - in this case - lbs. or kgs. Another company buys fresh fruits in bulk, which then goes to process and store for drying. The fruits naturally reduce their weight due to the drying process. The business then packages and sells the dried produce to retailers. Again, this leads to effective differences in the accounting records for the procured and sold quantities. Industries That Typically Deal with Variable Measurement Ratios of Products Variable Measurement Ratios, especially Catch Weight, are typical for industries specialized in process manufacturing , dosing , and packaging , such as food and beverage production, steel and aluminium processing, textile manufacturing, and many others. Their products require a specialized solution which can take into account all specific cases and details . ERP.net's Solution The Warehouse Management System of ERP.net is designed to fully support handling products with Catch Weight. The mobile application allows entering the weight measured for any piece of product that is subject to warehouse operations. The data for these products and operations is stored directly in the integrated database of ERP.net and gets transferred through the whole dataflow , acting on the inventory management system's records , and respectively, on the warehouse transactions for these activities."

TYPICAL FLOW In the typical flow, the zones are sequantially numbered from 1 to 6, depending on their closeness to shipping. 1 IN → 2 INSP → 3 BULK → 4 PICK → 5 PACK → 6 OUT ON Receive ON RECEIVE process rules for each zone: IN → INSP Q:OK INSP → BULK Q:NOT-OK INSP → QUARANTINE The receive process moves the goods from the inbound docks to the inspection zone. After the goods are inspected, they are moved either to the bulk storage zone or to the quarantine zone. ON Optimize BULK → PICK (based on minimal qty) The optimize process is run twice per day. It ensures, that the picking zone has enough quantities to serve sales orders. ON Dispatch PICK → PACK PACK → OUT OUT: DISPATCH After a sales order is picked, it is sent to the packing tables and then to the outbound docks. KITTING With the kitting workflow, some items might need kitting, before they are sent to the customers. 1 IN → 2 INSP → 3 BULK → 4 PICK → 5 KIT → 6 PACK → 7 OUT ON Receive IN → INSP Q:OK INSP → BULK Q:NOT-OK INSP → QUARANTINE The receive process moves the goods from the inbound docks to the inspection zone. After the goods are inspected, they are moved either to the bulk storage zone or to the quarantine zone. ON Optimize BULK → PICK (based on minimal qty) PICK: KIT The optimize process is run twice per day. It ensures, that the picking zone has enough quantities to serve sales orders. The kitting task is performed in the picking zone, again based on minimal quantities. ON Dispatch PICK → PACK KIT → PACK PACK → OUT OUT: DISPATCH Here, two rules compete for the quantities of the order. If there are enough quantities in the picking zone, the order is picked immediately. If not, the remaining quantities are scheduled for kitting first. After a sales order is kitted and picked, it is sent to the packing tables and then to the outbound docks. CROSS-DOCKING 1 IN → 2 OUT ON Receive IN: IF CROSS_DOCK → OUT ON Dispatch OUT: DISPATCH Of course, the above rules can be easily combined with other rules. LABELLING The rules for labelling can easily be combined with other rules: ON Optimize PICK: LABEL (based on minimal qty) ON Dispatch PICK: LABEL (based on order qty)"

    "title": "Zone Based Routing | ERP.net Information",
    "keywords": "Zone Based Routing The basic idea With Zone based routing, the rules for processing the goods are determined based on the zone, in which the goods are stored for each step. The zones are sequentially numbered, relative to their \"closeness\" to final shipping. For example: 1 IN -> 2 INSP -> 3 BULK -> 4 PICK -> 5 KIT -> 6 PACK -> 7 OUT RECEIVE ------------> --OPTIMIZE--> ----------------> DISPATCH The main processes in the warehouse - receive, optimize and dispatch, are ordered consecutively through the zone sequence. The receive process starts at the inbound docks and runs until goods are placed in bulk. The optimization process usually deals with replenishment of the picking zones, but can also be used for pre-kitting. The planning of the dispatch process works backwards - from the final step (the dispatch from the outbound docks) to the first step (usually picking). This is similar to how MRP/DRP works, but applied for WMS. Zone based routing and sequencing provides great flexibility in the route formation process, while keeping things simple and understandable for the process designers. It allows the process designers to focus separately on each zone, leaving the complex full routing formation to the system. Zone based routing allows programming of very complicated routes, while still keeping things simple and maintainable. How it works? For each zone, there are rules, which define how the goods will be processed, when they pass the zone. The rules for a zone are defined separately for each of the WMS processes - receive, dispatch and replenishment. The full route is the concatenation of all route steps for each consecutive zone. Hierarchical rules Since zones are hierarchical, for any given zone there might be multiple rules, coming from different levels of the hierarchy. All rules in the hierarchy are combined when creating the routing. Combining the rules is performed separately for each STEP NO within each zone. To determine the \"winning\" rule for each step, the RULE PRIORITY is used within all rules, which satisfy the RULE CONDITIONs. Start and finish of the process The receive process starts at the inbound dock and is planned through the zones, until there are no more steps. Usually, it finishes at the BULK zone. The dispatch process works in the opposite way - it first determines the quantities needed at the outbound docks, and than determines what previous steps could supply these quantities. The optimization process is a middle ground - it just runs for all zones, for which there is a definition for the optimization process. Related topics: Zone-based routing examples"

It offers very convenient tools to graphically represent production programs. You can make daily adjustments to the production plan with just a few clicks, and the edited operation moves to another day or hour. How does CRP work? When a new product for manufacturing is entered in the system, It needs to be assigned a production technology which defines the machines and the length of processing it is supposed to go through. In order for the production technology to be described, the system needs to have information about the available resources (machines) and their production capacity. When the system calculates a production schedule, it checks the needs of all products and tries to match them with the available resources. The system sorts orders according by priority and monitors production deadlines. If there is a problem that interferes with the time limit, the system will warn you and mark the order in red, so you can check it and decide how to proceed. Although the system can automatically calculate production schedules, the final decision is yours. You can approve a schedule or modify it. It is often necessary to implement emergency orders, which rearranges the approved plan. To avoid this situation, production management theory recommends to plan a resource load of 75% -95%, depending on manufacturing specifics and batch sizes, but never 100%. Capacity requirements planning requires efforts – you need to enter information about you resources, technologies and products in advance. But this work will pay off because ERP.net CRP will drastically increase the efficiency and effectiveness of your employees in charge of planning."

    "keywords": "Material Requirements Planning The main purpose of module Material requirements planning (MRP), together with subsystem Logistics, in ERP.net is to provide products and materials at the right time, the right place. The module is meant to maintain a smooth logistics process based on formulations, technology, orders from customers and to suppliers, inventory, sales projections, etc. In case of shortage of a raw material, semi-finished or finished product, the system alerts the relevant staff and offers supply suggestions which can be approved with one click. Integration with other modules in the system The MRP module, together with subsystem Logistics, provides all necessary means to completely cover the logistics process in any business. Control of supplies planned by the system In case of shortage of a raw material, semi-finished or finished product, the system alerts the relevant staff and offers supply suggestions which can be approved with one click. Planning methods supported by the system Shortfall products can be obtained in several ways: In-house production CMT production from an external counterparty Purchase Transfer from another warehouse The module can support a preferred method of planning for each product. The system supports both centralized and decentralized planning. For example, you can set the module to offer purchase from a supplier in case of shortage in the central warehouse, while deficits in other warehouses can trigger a suggestion to transfer from the central one. There is also one more option – if there is a shortage in any warehouse, a purchase from an external supplier can be planned. The quantity dimension of any shortfall can be calculated by several methods: Minimum availability – if availability falls below a certain minimum amount, the system suggests an order to reach back the target value. Calculating MRP – this method calculates the exact amount which is necessary for the planning period. Economic order – comparing the cost for preparing and and transportation of an order to the cost of storing these goods in a warehouse. At regular intervals – this method offers to order the quantity consumed during the previous interval. Once you precise amount, the system can adjust it to meet certain criteria. The criteria that the system supports are: Batch size – with this criterion, orders are always multiples of the given size. Minimum/maximum – the supplier may require a minimum (more often) or a maximum amount of an order. Using the given methods and criteria, the system calculates and suggests an order. The final decision on the confirmation or modification of the suggestion, however, is taken by an employee working with the program. You must keep in mind that accurate supply operations require the following subsystems to also function with a high level of precision: Inventory management – if inventory data is not up-to-date and real-time, the supply system may generate inaccurate order suggestions. Sales projections – projections of future sales are not mandatory but can contribute to the optimization of supply suggestions. Customer orders – they reveal the real-life demand for finished products, and if they are not entered correctly, supply will give inaccurate suggestions. Recipes in manufacturing – they are used to decompose the needs for finished products to needs for materials or manufactured products. If recipes are not true, it will lead to erroneous suggestions for supply. Document types The module works with several document types that cover the entire supply process: Transfer order – for the transfer of goods from a warehouse/storage space to another warehouse/storage space. Replenishment order – this is an order that addresses the need for products in a warehouse. It can come from different departments and is created by demand, with specifying a * supplier and prices not being obligatory. Such an order is processed by the Supply Department, which then uses it to generate a purchase order. Purchase order – such an order can be proposed by the system (document status: Planned) or made manually. It indicates an intention to buy a product from a specific provider, at a certain (optional) price. Receiving order – this type of document provides input control over supplies and a comparison between the ordered goods, the received goods and the invoice – the so-called “triple-check.” Module Material planning has high requirements to function properly but the benefits it brings are many times more than the efforts for its implementation. With this module, you can have more timely dispatches and optimize inventory and the time to process an order. The module is suitable for use by both manufacturing and distribution companies. One solution for the entire organization ERP.net is a solution that can cover all key business processes in your company. It does not matter whether the individual modules are implemented simultaneously or added at a later stage, they will always be fully integrated. You can use the accumulated data from all modules to make detailed reports that let you analyze your results in detail and prepare budgets and projections for future periods."

Line number 10 is the only line in the calculated attribute The return value is the value of the attribute DefaultPaymentTermDays in the Customer entity. Example - Complex filter and summation The following calculated attribute sums all sales order lines, whose product: has a user data attribute, called \"CustPropPrj\", equal to '500' has a Name, containing the word 'Tool' No Operation Param1 Param2 Param3 10 SUM EXP:20 ATTRIB:LineAmount 20 FILTER CHILD:Lines EXP:30 30 IN ATTRIB:Product EXP:40 40 FILTER QUERY:Gen_Products EXP:50 50 AND EXP:60 EXP:70 60 EQUALS ATTRIB:CustPropPrj CONST:500 70 LIKE ATTRIB:Name CONST:'Tool' Explanation: Line 10: Iterates through the data set, specified on Line 20 (EXP:20), then SUMs the attribute LineAmount. Line 20: Filters the Lines subset with the filter, specified in Line 30 (EXP:30). Line 30: Creates a filter, which will be satisfied only by products, specified in the query on Line 40 (EXP:40). Line 40: Creates a query, which filters the products with the condition, specified on Line 50. Line 50: Specifies that the condition is comprised of two conditions, linked with AND. Line 60: Specifies that the first condition is the value of an attribute, called CustPropPrj should be 500. Line 70: Specifies that the second condition is that the Name of the product should contain 'Tool'. This example demonstrates, that Calculated Attributes can calculate very complicated formulas, query the database, get related values, etc."

    "title": "Multi-language support | ERP.net Information",
    "keywords": "Multi-language support Description Many string attributes in ERP.net support saving the data in multiple languages. These attributes are called Multi-language Strings. For example, the Product Name of a Product can be entered in many languages simultaneously. When visualizing the data, the correct language version of the string is displayed automatically by the system, depending on the current user language. Note For reports, the report designer can specify whether to use the current user language or always use a fixed language. For example, for a Portuguese invoice, one would require that the labels and data are always displayed in Portuguese. Entering data in multiple languages The client applications of ERP.net usually allow the following abilities regarding multi-language strings: Enter the string in many languages Transliterate a string from one language to another (or all) Translate a string from one language to another (or all) When entering translations for a multi-language string, the client application usually displays a table with cells for each language translation, similar to this: Language Value EN: Toothpaste DE: Zahnpasta Depending on the client application, translation can sometimes also be automated. Some client applications support using an online service, like Google Translate to automatically translate a string to other languages. Translation is better suited to Description and Notes attributes. Transliteration Transliteration is the process of translating one language version of a string to another, based on the sounding of the string. Transliteration works great for person and company names and addresses. It allows branch offices to work in their local language and reports can still be shown in the corporate language. For example, the Russian word \"Иван\" would be transliterated in English as \"Ivan\". Transliteration works in two ways - manual and automatic. Manual transliteration \"Manual\" transliteration is actually automatic, but is initiated manually while editing the different language versions of a multi-language string. While editing multi-language string, the client application usually provides a function button, which transliterates the current language version to other languages. Automatic transliteration Automatic transliteration occurs when the system needs to display some a multi-language string in some language, but that specific language translation is not saved in the database. For example, suppose one employee works in a branch office in Russia and enters \"Иван\" as a person first name. The database saves only the Russian language version. Then another employee at a UK location requests to see the first name of the same person. The system would automatically transliterate the string and display it as \"Ivan\". Note Transliteration works optimally between Latin and Cyrillic."

Stored Attributes store values in the database, extending the system tables. Similarity With System Attributes The stored attributes behave mostly like the system attributes. They can be shown in columns, grouped and filtered in navigators just like system attributes. Again similar to system attributes, they can have default values and be shown in the view of data forms. Most of the time, the end users can't (and do not even need to) distinguish between system and stored attributes. It is up to the implementation team to define stored attributes that fit best the implementation requirements. Make Proper Use of Stored Attributes Note Many stored attributes can easily be defined and set as \"required\". However, this might endanger the whole ERP implementation, since requiring too much data entry for each operation can alienate the end users from the system. Carefully balance the business needs with the end user comfort. Store Attributes are a powerful and flexible solution, and as such, must be used with the proper care and attention to detail."

Without touching your mouse, you can simply hit the Enter key and jump straight to the next important data entry. You can define which form fields can be navigated to with the Enter key, so that upon a keystroke, only these fields get highlighted to be edited. These are called Enter stops. You can also use Enter stops to quickly navigate not only to fields and lines but also to whole panels. Of course, all other fields and panels are still visible and editable. Thus, users, roles within the company, or the whole company, for that matter, can streamline processes, based on task or form specifics. For example, when you enter a new sales order, the form may contain lots of fields that may not be relevant to your role or to the task at hand. Usually you just need to enter details about the product ordered, its price and required quantity. Thus, to save your time and avoid clicking through every single field or panel of the form, you select as Enter stops only the fields and panels applicable to your current workflow and context, so that you can quickly navigate to them, skipping all the rest."

Click to call Customer identification on incoming call Call notes Customer identification on incoming call allows one-click opening of the 360-degree dossier of the customer. Which PBX systems can be integrated with the call center functionality? Currently, only Asterix is supported natively as server-to-server functionality. Other systems, requiring client-only connections are left as third-party solutions. In the future, all real-time call-center functionality will be implemented as apps (internal or third-party). This will allow much greater scaling of the connectivity features. Which email servers are supported for the email integration? Exchange, IMAP, POP3. Note Currently, Exchange integration can also be used for Office 365. However, in 2021, Microsoft intends to disable Exchange functionality for Office 365 and this connection will no longer be usable for Office 365.

    "title": "Hosting & Reliability FAQ | ERP.net Information",
    "keywords": "Hosting & Reliability FAQ High Availability & Monitoring Does the ERP.net service feature high availability? Yes. There are many components in an ERP instance - database, application servers, web servers, apps, reverse proxy, process manager, etc. Each component is hosted on a hardware, which is always having a stand-by backup hardware, ready to take over in a case of a hardware failure. All network components are also stacked for high availability. Each network component is cross-connected to each host. The point is, there is no single point of failure. Is the system monitored at all times? Yes. There is a dedicated team, monitoring all systems 24x7x365. In case of an issue, reaction time is usually in the 5-15 minutes range, day and night. What happens in case of a hardware problem? The most important part is the problem to be automatically detected by the watchdog systems. Once the problem is detected, an automatic failover occurs. The failover is usually within 30-60 seconds. Most of the time, the users might notice just a slight delay in their processing. What is the reaction time in case of an issue? First of all, most issues auto-resolve themselves, because each component has high-availability and the workload is automatically transferred to another node. However, should it reach to a human intervention, the reaction time usually is within 5-15 minutes, day and night, 24x7x365. Is the system monitored from outside? Yes. There are at least two different locations, usually in different countries or states, which has automatic watchdogs setup. Each alarm for non-availability is reviewed by human operators. Disaster Recovery & Backups Are there backups of my data? Yes. We hope you are joking and this is a rhetorical question 🙂. Seriously, the backup planning, execution and control is one of most important activities out there. You can read more about backups in the Disaster Recovery section. Is the off-site backup included in the price? Yes. The off-site backup is included in the price for all subscription levels. You do not need to do anything in order to be fully protected. Miscellaneous What hardware is used for the service? There are a lot of moving parts in a proper ERP service. Reliability is the most important factor when choosing the correct hardware. Performance comes second, but is also of paramount importance. It is hard to describe all hardware, but here are some quick facts: Database servers: Top of the line, data center grade, specialized frequency optimized CPU. These usually cost around 10 times more per core than regular CPUs. 32 GB RAM per core. Specialized memory-class SSD drives for caching and temp db. Top of the line SSDs for databases. 100 Gbit network connections to backup and hot-stand-by server. 25 Gbit network connection to application servers. Application servers: Enterprise grade general-purpose CPU for application processing. 8 GB (up from 4 until 2023) RAM per application core. SSDs for storage. 25 Gbit network connections Network components: Enterprise grade routers, switches, firewalls, etc. What database size to expect? Database sizes vary depending on many factors: Regular user processing. Automation by applications. Storage of documents, pictures, etc. Use of Track Changes feature. etc. We can only try to predict, with big tolerance for error, the regular user processing. As a rule of thumb, each user generates approximately between 0.25 and 1.00 GB of data per year."

To achieve the highest level of audit tracking and GDPR compliance, the system can be configured to track reads. This can be very space-consuming and should be used judiciously. Both reads of individual records and requests for general reports can be tracked. Report requests tracks just as the applied filters, not the actual data read.

    "keywords": "Concurrent Sessions-Based Licensing Instances of ERP.net which are registered and paid by the subscription plans Small Business Basic and Small Business Advanced are licensed under the Concurrent Sessions-Based licensing. This type of license allows the client to run a number of active sessions at the same time. Single Concurrent Session Definition A single concurrent session for an ERP.net instance is an active connection established between a single desktop application , or web or mobile client , on a single user's device , on one side, and the ERP.net system's instance , on the other. This session grants access to the ERP.net instance for this user via this single application or web client on a desktop computer, laptop, or mobile device (a smartphone, tablet, or other). Example of a Singe Concurrent Session An example of the former will be if you start a single instance of your desktop application OR a single instance of your web client , and then use it to connect to your ERP.net instance covered by your subscription plan. If no specific conditions apply, this will be deemed a single active and concurrent session between your user's application and your ERP.net instance . Multiple Concurrent Sessions Definition Multiple concurrent sessions for an ERP.net instance occur when multiple active connections between applications and/or web clients are established to the ERP.net instance . These sessions allow you to execute, control, manage, and oversee your business processes from multiple locations, devices, and by multiple people and automated applications simultaneously. Example of Multiple Active and Concurrent Sessions An example of multiple concurrent sessions will be if three users start their own single instances of their applications OR web clients, and then use each of these instances to connect to your ERP.net instance covered by your subscription plan. This will lead to at least * three concurrent sessions for your ERP.net instance. Note A single device running multiple applications and/or web clients actively connected to ERP.net, as well as a single user connecting to ERP.net from multiple devices (regardless of using an application or web client), all at the same time, will result in multiple concurrent sessions . Concurrent Sessions for Small Business Subscription Plans The starting maximum allowed number of concurring sessions is defined as a base number for each of the Small Business subscription plans. Currently, the starting maximum number of allowed concurrent sessions is as follows: Small Business Basic - starts at a maximum of three concurrent sessions Small Business Advanced - starts at a maximum number of five concurrent sessions . Number of Users Allowed by a Single License Additional concurrent sessions for your license may be purchased in accordance with our price lists. The maximum number of concurrent sessions available for purchase is 35 for all Small Business subscription plans. If your ERP.net instance exceeds this number of concurrent sessions and still does not cover your needs, we would be happy to offer a subscription plan that better matches your type of business and its needs. User Perspective and What This Means for You For your business this means you and your team can have as many active and unactive users and devices configured to use your ERP.net instance as you like, even if the full number of users and devices exceeds the maximum allowed number of concurrent sessions in your personal subscription plan. As long as the maximum number of concurrent sessions that are running between your applications and web clients , on one hand, and the ERP.net system instance , on the other, at the same time , does not exceed the maximum allowed number of concurrent sessions for your plan, your stakeholders can use the platform fully functionally without any licensing obstacles. Note The full number of devices that are configured to access or have previously accessed the system, as well as the full number of users that are granted rights for accessing your ERP.net instance are not limited by any manner regarding your license. Only sessions which are active and run simultaneously are treated as concurrent. You will not be charged for the number of devices or user accounts you have set up for using ERP.net platform. Specific Cases and Conditions There are specific cases in which a single application actively connected to ERP.net may result in creating more than one concurrent sessions. External applications , implemented by your ERP.net vendor and running parallel with other external applications or parallel with the core system of ERP.net, are one example of applications that can create multiple concurrent sessions . Note If a single application is trying to combine the work and processes of multiple other applications or internal users, this application will use the according number of concurrent sessions to function in a sustainable and proper manner."

User perspective From users perspective, a core provides enough capacity for comfortable work of 30 concurrent internal users , or up to 45 concurrent light-use users . However, todays workloads are rarely just internal users, using the default UI clients. Service apps, Internet users and third-party UI apps take their toll. Their load levels are hard to predict. Note Small business subscriptions are based on concurrent internal users only, and not on cores. They can incorporate service and Internet apps, but their load is prorated to internal users. Check your reseller for more information. Hardware capacity description Although \"core\" licensing is originally based on hardware specifications, nowadays it is sized through software and the exact hardware specs are just an approximation. The core licensing is defined based on the users perspective and hardware capacity is just an approximation. Having said that, each core is allocated capacity, approximately equal to: 1 CPU core of a specialized frequency-optimized CPU for database processing (per licensed core) 32 GB RAM for database processing (per licensed core) 1 CPU core of a general purpose server CPU for application processing (per licensed core) 4 GB RAM for application processing (per licensed core)"

Your business can create and store a practically unlimited number of inactive user accounts in your ERP.net platform. After reaching the permitted number of active users for your subscription, any additional accounts you create can only be set as inactive . Note You can easily switch which users are active in your ERP.net platform's interface. Changing an active user to inactive frees up a slot. This slot can be used for another inactive user to be set as active. Additional information Per-user sessions Editions that are licensed on a registered user basis allow all of your active registered users to use the ERP.net platform simultaneously , as long as everyone is accessing the platform through a single session . A single session is brought up and active when a user is accessing ERP.net platform via either: ERP.net's desktop client ERP.net's web client through a single browser of choice on a single device at a time . Multi-session access Accessing ERP.net platform by the same user via multiple desktop clients, browsers, operating systems, and devices is also possible. This is a multi-session access .

The web applications operates with the ERP instance using Application Accounts on behalf of the external users. Tip External users do not directly count towards the licensed concurrent session limits. However, the underlying web applications can consume sessions, usually much less than the operating external users (usually just 1 session). Application accounts Application accounts are special types of users, used by service applications. They have special kind of non-human login, but are otherwise identical to internal users. Tip For all licensing and operational purposes, application accounts are considered similar to internal users. Virtual users Virtual users cannot login in the system or access any web content.

Backups The automated backup plan includes: Transaction log backups every 30 minutes. Full backups every week. Secondary replica of backups in a different physical location (different data center). Retention period - 14 days. Manual test restores every year to test the backup procedures. Backup monitoring The proper execution of the backup procedures is monitored at all times. The procedures include manual checks and test restores, guaranteeing proper execution of the disaster recovery solutions. User requested restores We are able to execute user requested restores. The restore takes place as a new ERP instance, which is subject to a subscription plan. User access to the backups Unfortunately, users access to the backup files is not allowed for security reasons. However, the data in an ERP instance is readily accessible through the Table API, which is a thin layer over the physical database. The Table API, although primarily intended for BI (Business Intelligence), can be used for data dumping, subject to the security permissions. Note Access through the Table API is logged."

Many types of resources can be protected with keys: Subsystems Entity types Individual records Individual attributes Visuals, like forms, panels, etc. etc. To access a protected resource, the user must possess the required access key. User Groups Permissions are managed through User Groups. A user group gives access to a list of access keys. The members of the user group receive access to all keys in the group. Note There is no way to revoke access to specific access key for specific user. When a user is added to a security group, they receive all keys. Design carefully your security framework, so that revoking is not required. Action permissions Access keys give general permission to access a resource. This gives the permission to retrieve the resource from the database. However, this might not give permission for specific operations (actions) over the resource. Each resource type has a pre-defined set of actions, which might require permissions. When a security group is assigned an access key, the assignment also specifies which actions are allowed. Basic actions, which most data resource types define are: Update Delete Note Read is included in the access key."

ERP.net is not liable for any damages caused to the Customer by unregistered Reseller. 5.2.3. Liability Any additional Services, including support, account management, Bundles and special offers are provided according to the additional rules for Resellers located on the ERP.net Reseller web page. The ERP.net limits its liability for any actions and omissions of a Reseller, subject to the limitations in section 12, and may, at their discretion, assist a Customer in resolving the issue. 5.2.4. Resellers as Administrators If Customer order Cloud Services through a Reseller, then the Customer is responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in the applicable agreement with the Reseller. As between Customer and ERP.net, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other User Accounts. 5.3. Responsibility for Users Some Cloud Services require Users to be designated by Administrators and some may allow Users to invite other Users. The appointed Administrator is responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Service you use and for controlling whom you allow to become a User. If payment is required for Users to use or access a Cloud Services, then we are only required to provide the Cloud Services to those Users for whom you have paid the applicable fees, and only such Users are permitted to access and use the Cloud Services. Some Cloud Services may allow you to designate different types of Users, in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of User. You are responsible for compliance with this Agreement by all Users, including for any payment obligations. You are responsible for the activities of all Users, including Subscription Orders they may place and how Users use Your Data, even if those Users are not from your organization or domain. The Administrator and the Customer are directly responsible for any damages resulting from User activity. 6. Platform rights and responsibilities 6.1. System Availability 6.1.1. Service Level Commitment ERP.net commits to provide 99.5% uptime with respect to the Customer’s Service for every month of the duration of the Agreement, excluding regular maintenance times and Unforeseen events or actions. If in any calendar month this uptime commitment is not met by ERP.net and Customer was negatively impacted (i.e., attempted to log into or access the Service and failed due to the unscheduled downtime of the Service), ERP.net shall provide, as the sole and exclusive remedy, a credit note equal to 50% of a monthly fee for the use of the Service. 6.1.2. Scheduled and Unscheduled Maintenance Scheduled maintenance times does not count as downtime. Unscheduled Maintenance will be counted against the uptime guarantee unless such maintenance is preformed when it’s necessary to ensure a higher level of security and stability of the Services. 6.1.2.1. Scheduled Maintenance Maintenance time is scheduled if it is communicated with an Administrator at least two full business days in advance of the maintenance time. Scheduled maintenance time typically is to occur at night on the weekend. Scheduled maintenance is performed once or twice a year. 6.1.2.2. Unscheduled Maintenance ERP.net in its sole discretion may take the Service down for Unscheduled maintenance and in that event will attempt to notify Customer and/or Administrator in advance. Unscheduled Maintenance, which is performed when it’s necessary to ensure a higher level of security and stability of the Services will be typically scheduled to occur at night - 10:00 pm - 12:30 am, based on the time zone of the Cloud Server location, chosen by Administrator or Customer in the Subscription Order, and should not exceed one hour. 6.1.3. Postponement of an update Depending on the Support Services and Usage Limits, specified in the Subscription Orders by the Customer, ERP.net offers shared or private servers to its Customers. Customers who use shared servers do not have the opportunity to postpone scheduled upgrades and such are done according to the information on the official site and by the terms in Section 6.1.2. Customer with private servers have the option to postpone the update. The updates can be postponed only once and for maximum 1 (one) month. Customer should open a support ticket, based on the procedure in Section 6.2., indicating the period for which the update should be postponed. Non-updated servers pose security and maintenance risks, therefore ERP.net cannot guarantee the normal operation or full functionality of the system during this time. ERP.net will not be responsible, during this period, for any data leaks, security problems, system malfunction or difficulties accessing the Cloud Services. 6.1.4. Credit note request In order to receive a credit note under this service level commitment, Customer must request it simply by emailing ERP.net billing e-mail, no later than five days after the end of the applicable month. If Customer submits a credit request and does not receive a prompt automated response indicating that the request was received, Customer must resubmit the request because the submission was not properly received and will not result in a credit. The issued credit note is automatically deducted from the next monthly invoice. ERP.net shall calculate any service level downtime using ERP.net’s system logs and other records. 6.1.5. Refusal of credit ERP.net reserves the right to refuse to issue a credit note in case any of the following conditions are not met: At the time of the system unavailability, the Customer should not be in default or past due any of the payments to ERP.net or their Affiliates. Customer should not have breached any of the contractual obligation before or after the system unavailability. 6.2. Support 6.2.1. Bugs and problems For the duration of this Agreement, ERP.net commits to making all reasonable efforts to remedy any Bug of the Cloud Services submitted by the Customer through the appropriate channel (typically, the web form or phone numbers listed on the Help page, or when working with a Reseller, the channel provided by them), and to start handling such Customer submissions within 2 business days. The period of 2 business days starts from the moment when a complete and detailed report about the Bug/s is provided, which should have a minimum information about: (a) what functionality was used, (b) what was the intended result, (c) what are the steps that were taken before the problem occurred, (d) what was the status of the user who tried to perform the action. As soon as the Bug is fixed an appropriate remedy will be communicated to the Customer. Both parties acknowledge that as specified in the license of the Cloud Services and in Section 12 of this Agreement, ERP.net cannot be held liable for Bugs in the Cloud Services. 6.2.2. Scope For the duration of this Agreement, the Customer may open up to 10 (ten) support tickets per month for each instance of Cloud Platform they have, free of charge. The support tickets should cover questions regarding Bugs or Performance and Connectivity issues. Other assistance requests, such as questions related to development or customizations may be covered through the purchase of a separate Support services Agreement. In case it’s not clear, if a request is covered by this Agreement, the decision is at the discretion of ERP.net. 6.2.3. Availability Tickets can be submitted via the web form or phone numbers listed on Help page. If a Customer is working with a Reseller, they can also send tickets through the channel provided by the Reseller, subject to their working hours. 6.3. Third-Party developers 6.3.1. Third-party’s products and services ERP.net or Third-party may make available (for example, through the Marketplace or otherwise) Third-party products or services, including, for example, Third-party Applications and implementation and other Consulting services. Any acquisition by Customer of such products or services, and any exchange of data between Customer and any Third-party’s product or service is solely between Customer and the applicable Third-party. ERP.net does not warrant or support Third-party Applications or other Third-party products or services, whether or not they are designated by ERP.net as “certified” or otherwise, unless expressly provided otherwise in a Subscription Order. ERP.net is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data resulting from access by such Third-party Application or its provider. 6.3.2. Integration with Third-party Applications The Services may contain features designed to interoperate with Third-party Applications. ERP.net cannot guarantee the continued availability of such Service features and may cease providing them without entitling Customer to any refund, credit, or other compensation, if for example and without limitation, the provider of a Third-party Application ceases to make the Third-party Application available for interoperation with the corresponding Service features in a manner acceptable to ERP.net. 6.3.3. Removal of Content and Third-party Applications If Customer receives notice that Third-party Application must be removed, modified and/or disabled to avoid violating applicable law, third-party rights, Customer will promptly do so. If Customer does not take required action in accordance with the above, or if in ERP.net’s judgment continued violation is likely to reoccur, ERP.net may disable the applicable Service and/or Third-party Application. If requested by ERP.net, Customer shall confirm such deletion and discontinuance of use in writing and ERP.net shall be authorized to provide a copy of such confirmation to any such third-party claimant or governmental authority, as applicable. In addition, if ERP.net is required by any third-party rights holder to remove content or receives information that content provided to Customer may violate applicable law or third-party rights, ERP.net may discontinue Customer’s access to content through the Services. 6.3.4. Marketplace apps and tools ERP.net offers applications developed by them or by third-parties through its official Marketplace, which are certified and have met the minimum requirements for working with Cloud services and software. However, each Customer has the right to use applications in conjunction with Cloud services that are not downloaded from the Marketplace, and Customer guarantees that they and their work with them will not violate the rules of this Agreement. ERP.net certifies the various applications so that the Customer can choose safe and reliable applications for their work process. ERP.net ensures that the applications uploaded to the Marketplace (class A) meet the minimum requirements for security and reliability, and that they do not collect unnecessary information about the Customer. All applications that are not in class A are uncertified and ERP.net does not give any guarantees or warranties if the Customer chooses to integrate such applications in its work. 7. Use and restriction of the platform 7.1. Usage Limits Services are subject to usage limits specified in Subscription Orders and Documentation. If Customer exceeds a contractual usage limit, ERP.net may work with Customer to seek to reduce Customer’s usage so that it conforms to that limit. If, notwithstanding ERP.net’s efforts, Customer is unable or unwilling to abide by a contractual usage limit, Customer will execute a Subscription Order for additional quantities of the applicable Services promptly upon ERP.net’s request, and/or pay any invoice for excess usage in accordance with the “Invoicing and Payment” section below. The use of one User account by several different Users is expressly prohibited and will be considered a gross violation of this Agreement, which may result in termination of all Services without notice. This limit doesn’t apply for Business Partners accounts. If a Business Partner should access the system, a request for this is submitted through the platform and a Business Partner account of the given legal entity is created, which can be accessed by several Users. Additionally, the ERP.net may, at its discretion, provide Free services under section 4.1.5. to Customer who they consider that is classified for them according to the internal ERP.net rules (universities, non-governmental organizations, churches). In such cases, the usage is limited to the resources that the ERP.net has decided to provide free of charge and according to the constraints it deems appropriate for the need of the Customer, stated in the Subscription Order. 7.1.1. Different type of usage limits Session Based – this is a type of limitation that entitles the Customer to use the Cloud Service by User sessions, regardless of who the individual User is. In this case the number of licenses is equal to the number of User sessions, which can be performed simultaneously by Users of the Customer, which means there are no restriction on the number of registered Users. User Based – this is a type of limitation that entitles 1 /one/ individual User, identified in an Subscription Order, or in another appropriate way, to use the Cloud Services. In this case, the number of licenses is equal to the number of individual Users who can use the Cloud Services, which means there are restriction on the number of registered Users. Resource Based – this is a type of limitation that gives the Customer the right to use a certain capacity of the Cloud Services – until a certain load of resources or monthly quota is reached. Purpose Based – this is a type of limitation that limits the number of records in one instance of the Cloud Services to a certain number or a type (e.g., number of invoices for a month, number of cars, specific type of records etc.). Functionality Based – defines the functional modules or specific functions of the Cloud Services, which are subject to the license. Multiple usage limits may be applied to Customer, based on their Subscription Order and personal and business needs. 7.2. Bundles Customer or Developer, who has developed an application that integrates and requires a license for the ERP.net Cloud Platform, is not allowed to purchase licenses or act as an intermediary or reseller of such in order to sell them in a Bundle. In case a Customer or a Developer wants to make their application available to other Customers and Users, they can sell it without a license for the ERP.net Cloud Platform through the official Marketplace or through their own channels. If a Customer or a Developer wants to offer licenses for the ERP.net Cloud Platform, they can sign a Partnership agreement and be included in the official ERP.net reseller lists. If a Customer or a Developer wants, independently of the ERP.net, to develop apps, and offer them in Bundles with ERP.net Cloud Platform licenses, they should sign a separate Developer agreement. 7.3. Reservation of Rights Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder, ERP.net, its Affiliates and its licensors reserve all of their right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all of their related intellectual property rights. No rights are granted to Customer hereunder other than as expressly set forth herein. 7.4. Ownership of Customer Data As between ERP.net and Customer, all title and intellectual property rights in and to the Customer Data is owned exclusively by Customer. Customer acknowledges and agrees that in connection with the provision of the Services, ERP.net may store and maintain Customer Data for a period of time consistent with ERP.net’s standard business processes for the Services. Following expiration or termination of the Agreement or a Customer account, if applicable, ERP.net may deactivate the applicable Customer and User account(s) and delete any data therein. Customer grants ERP.net the right to host, use, process, display and transmit Customer Data to provide the Services pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Subscription Order. Customer has sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of Customer Data, and for obtaining all rights related to Customer Data required by ERP.net to perform the Services. 7.5. ERP.net Intellectual Property Rights All rights, title and interest in and to the Services (including without limitation all intellectual property rights therein and all modifications, extensions, customizations, scripts or other derivative works of the Services provided or developed by ERP.net) and anything developed or delivered by or on behalf of ERP.net under this Agreement are owned exclusively by ERP.net or its licensors. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights granted to Customer do not convey any rights in the Services, express or implied, or ownership in the Services or any intellectual property rights thereto. Any rights in the Services or ERP.net’s intellectual property not expressly granted herein by ERP.net are reserved by ERP.net. 7.6. Suggestions/Feedback Customer grants ERP.net and its Affiliates a royalty free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable right to use, modify, distribute and incorporate into the Services (without attribution of any kind) any suggestions, enhancement request, recommendations, proposals, correction or other feedback or information provided by Customer or any Users related to the operation or functionality of the Services or its Affiliates’ services. 7.7. Trademark Except where noticed otherwise in writing, each party grants the other a non-transferable, non-exclusive, royalty free, worldwide license to reproduce and display the other party’s name, logos and trademarks, solely for the purpose of referring to the other party as a customer or supplier, on websites, press releases and other marketing materials. 8. Privacy and Information 8.1. Confidentiality 8.1.1. Definition of Confidential Information “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information of Customer includes Customer Data; Confidential Information of ERP.net includes the Services and the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Subscription Orders (including pricing). Confidential Information of each party includes business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by such party. 8.1.2. Exceptions Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the non-disclosure obligations set forth in this “Confidentiality” section apply to Confidential Information exchanged between the parties in connection with the evaluation of additional ERP.net services. 8.1.3. Protection of Confidential Information As between the parties, each party retains all ownership rights in and to its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care). Each party agrees not to disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to any third party other than as set forth in the following sentence for a period of five years from the date of the disclosing party’s disclosure of the Confidential Information to the receiving party; however, ERP.net will protect the confidentiality of Customer Data residing in the Cloud Service for as long as such information resides in the Cloud Service. Each party may disclose Confidential Information only to those employees, agents or subcontractors who are required to protect it against unauthorized disclosure in a manner no less protective than required under this Agreement, and each party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information in any legal proceeding or to a governmental entity as required by law. ERP.net will protect the confidentiality of Customer Data residing in the Services in accordance with the ERP.net security practices applicable to Customer’s Subscription Order as described in this Agreement or such Subscription Order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ERP.net may disclose the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Subscription Order to a subcontractor or Third-party Developer to the extent necessary to perform ERP.net’s obligations under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective as set forth herein. 8.1.4. Compelled Disclosure The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information. 8.1.5. Publicity Neither party will use the name of the other party in publicity activities without the prior written consent of the other, except that Customer agrees that ERP.net may use Customer's name in customer listings or quarterly calls with its investors or, at times mutually agreeable to the parties, as part of ERP.net's marketing efforts (including reference calls and stories, press testimonials, site visits). Customer agrees that ERP.net may share information on Customer with its Affiliates for marketing and other business purposes and that it has secured appropriate authorizations to share Customer employee contact information with ERP.net. 8.1.6. Return of Information Upon written request, Customer will promptly return or destroy (and certify such destruction in writing) all Confidential Information in its possession. 8.2. Data protection 8.2.1. Protection of Customer Data ERP.net will maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Customer Data, as described in the Documentation. Those safeguards will include, but will not be limited to, measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of Customer Data (other than by Customer or Users). Except with respect to a free trial, the terms of the data processing addendum at Privacy and DPA page are hereby incorporated by reference and shall apply to the extent Customer Data includes Personal Data, as defined in the DPA. To the extent Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom and Switzerland are processed by us, ERP.net will not transfer personal data outside of EU, except in cases where that was explicitly demanded by the Customer or where it’s strictly necessary for the performance of the Service. In case of a data transfer outside of EEA in case there’s no Adequacy decision under art. 45 GDPR for this country/territory, the Customer agrees to a Standard Contractual Clauses, where Customer and its applicable Affiliates are each the data exporter, and Customer's acceptance of this Agreement, and an applicable Affiliate's execution of a Subscription Order, shall be treated as its execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses and Appendices. 8.2.2. Processing of Personal Data The parties acknowledge that the Customer’s database may contain Personal Data, for which the Customer is the Controller. This data will be processed by ERP.net the Customer instructs so, or if the Customer transfers their database or a part of their database to ERP.net for any reason pertaining to this Agreement. This processing will be performed in conformance with Data Protection Legislation. In particular, ERP.net commits to: only process the Personal Data when and as instructed by the Customer, and for the purpose of performing one of the Services under this Agreement, unless required by law to do so, in which case ERP.net will provide prior notice to the Customer, unless the law forbids it; ensure that all persons within ERP.net authorised to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality; implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, theft, alteration or disclosure; forward promptly to the Customer any Data Protection request that was submitted to ERP.net with regard to the Customer’s database; notify the Customer promptly upon becoming aware of and confirming any accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful processing of, disclosure of, or access to the Personal Data; notify the Customer if the processing instructions infringe applicable Data Protection Legislation, in the opinion of ERP.net; make available to the Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the Data Protection Legislation, allow for and contribute reasonably to audits, including inspections, conducted or mandated by the Customer; Customer agrees to provide ERP.net with accurate contact information at all times, as necessary to notify the Customer’s Data Protection responsible. 8.2.3. Subprocessors The Customer acknowledges and agrees that in order to provide the Services, ERP.net may use third-party service providers (Subprocessors) to process Personal Data. ERP.net commits to only use Subprocessors in compliance with Data Protection Legislation. This use will be covered by a contract between ERP.net and the Subprocessor that provides guarantees to that effect. 8.2.4. Transmission of Data Customer understands that the technical processing and transmission of Customer’s Electronic Communications is fundamentally necessary to use of the Cloud Service. Customer is responsible for cable or another Internet connection and up to date “browser” software in order to utilize the Cloud Service. Customer expressly consents to ERP.net’s interception and storage of Electronic Communications and/or Customer Data as needed to provide the Services hereunder, and Customer acknowledges and understands that Customer’s Electronic Communications will involve transmission over the Internet, and over various networks, only part of which may be owned and/or operated by ERP.net. Customer further acknowledges and understands that Electronic Communications may be accessed by unauthorized parties when communicated across the Internet, network communications facilities, telephone or other electronic means. Without limiting ERP.net’s applicable obligations under this Agreement, ERP.net is not responsible for any Electronic Communications and/or Customer Data which are delayed, lost, altered, intercepted or stored during the transmission of any data whatsoever across networks not owned and/or operated by ERP.net, including, but not limited to, the Internet and Customer’s local network. 8.2.5. Access to Customer Data Upon request by Customer made within 30 days after the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, ERP.net will make Customer Data available to Customer for export or download as provided in the Documentation. After such 30-day period, ERP.net will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Data, and as provided in the Documentation will thereafter delete or destroy all copies of Customer Data in its systems or otherwise in its possession or control, unless legally prohibited. For the duration of the Agreement, Customer can access its Customer Data at any time. Customer may export and retrieve its Customer Data in a standard format. Export and retrieval may be subject to technical limitations, in which case ERP.net and Customer will find a reasonable method to allow Customer access to Customer Data. Before the Agreement Term expires, Customer may use ERP.net’s API (Application Programming Interface) endpoint to perform a final export of Customer Data from the Cloud Service. In the event of third-party legal proceedings relating to the Customer Data, ERP.net will cooperate with Customer and comply with applicable law (both at Customer’s expense) with respect to handling of the Customer Data. 9. Invoices and Payment 9.1. Billing Models Billing Models are different approaches for pricing and charging a Customer based on their needs, use of the Services, and purchased licenses. ERP.net offers three types of Billing Models for their Customers. Billing Models are applied to the different Usage limits (see Section 7.1.1). Depending on the details specified in the Subscription Order one Billing Model can be applied to all Usage limits or different Billing Models can be chosen for specific Usage limits. 9.1.1. Types of Billing Models Subscription Billing Model – You commit in advance to purchase a specific quantity of Services and to pay upfront for each Billing Period as stated on the Subscription Order. Committed quantities not used during the month will expire at the end of it. Usage Billing Models (Pay-As-You-Go) – You pay based on actual usage in the preceding month with no upfront commitment. Payment is on a periodic basis, according to the Billing Period specified in the Subscription Order. Combined billing model (Pay-As-You-Grow) – This model combines the above two and it’s applied exceptionally to certain usage limits. Customer commits to specific quantity, which is paid upfront for every Billing Period (Subscription Model). In case the Customer's needs exceed this quantity, they are charged based on certain unit of cost (Usage Model). In the beginning of each Billing Period Customer is billed for all excess usage from the last Billing Period, plus the applicable subscription fee for the next. 9.1.2. Pre-set restrictions With respect to ERP.net Cloud Services, when Customer has chosen the Subscription Billing Model for a specific Usage limit, all additional or other usage (for example, usage beyond Customer’s commitment quantity) may be transformed to a Combined Billing Model for that particular Billing Period. ERP.net will try to notify Customer and the Administrator before such transformation occurs. 9.1.3. Default Billing Model Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Subscription Order or Documentation, the Subscription Billing Model should apply to the Purchased Services and their Usage limits for the duration of the Agreement. Customer can make a request for different combinations of Usage limits and Billing Models, but ERP.net reserves the right to prepare a personal offer that may better meet the needs of the Customer. 9.2. Agreement Term This Agreement commences on the date on which a Subscription Order is submitted by the Customer and shall continue in effect for an indefinite period of time until it is terminated in accordance with the provisions thereof. This Agreement is valid for the Subscription Orders which this Agreement accompanies. 9.3. Pricing and Payment Customer will provide ERP.net with valid and updated bank card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to ERP.net. If Customer provides bank card (credit card, debit card, virtual card etc.) information to ERP.net, Customer authorizes ERP.net to charge such bank card for all Purchased Services listed in the Subscription Order for the duration of this Agreement. Such charges shall be made either monthly or in accordance with any different Billing Period stated in Subscription Order. Depending on the Billing Models chosen, such charges will be made: In case of Subscription Billing Model – on the 1st of the month for the advance use for next Billing Period; In case of Usage Billing Models – on the 1st of the month for the use generated in the previous Billing Period; In case of Combined billing model – on the 1st of the month for the advance and used quantities; Regardless of the start date of the Agreement, the Customer’s card shall be charged or the Customer shall be invoiced on the 1st day of the month. All Services used prior to that day shall be included in the first charge or invoice, together with the Fees for the next month. If the Subscription Order specifies that payment will be by a method other than a bank card, ERP.net will invoice Customer in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Subscription Order. Unless otherwise stated in the Subscription Order, invoiced fees are due net 15 days from the invoice date. Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to ERP.net and notifying ERP.net of any changes to such information. Customer agrees that its purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by ERP.net regarding future functionality or features. 9.4. Renewal Except as otherwise specified in a Subscription Order, the Agreement Term will automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Agreement Term or one year (whichever is shorter), unless either party gives the other written notice (email acceptable) at least 30 days before the end of the relevant Agreement Term. Except as expressly provided in the applicable SubscriptionOrder, renewal of promotional or one-time prices will be at ERP.net’s applicable list price in effect at the time of the applicable renewal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any renewal in which Purchased Services volume or Agreement Term length for any Services has decreased from the prior term will result in re-pricing at renewal without regard to the prior term’s per-unit pricing. If there is no Contract End Date specified in the applicable Subscription Order, the Agreement shall renew automatically on the 1st of every month. 9.5. Price Changes 9.5.1. Change in Pricing Lists ERP.net may unilaterally change its pricing lists at any time. In such case, the prices under this Agreement shall change accordingly from the next Billing Period, provided that ERP.net has notified the Customer of such changes and the Agreement has remained in force. 9.5.2. Expiry of promotional prices Except as expressly provided in the applicable Subscription Order, promotional or one-time prices will revert back to ERP.net’s standard list prices at the start of the next Billing Period. 9.5.3. Change in Purchased Services The Customer may request an increase or decrease in the Purchased Services at any time by placing a new Subscription Order. In such case, the change in Services shall take effect from the start date of the new Subscription Order. If the Customer has removed or decreased any pre-paid Services, ERP.net shall retain the applicable pre-paid fees. If the Customer has increased his pre-paid Services, the price increase for the remainder of the then-current Billing Period will be added to the Customer’s invoice or bank charge for the next Billing Period. If the Services were not pre-paid, they will be charged accordingly at the end of the applicable Billing Period. 9.5.4. Clerical errors ERP.net reserves the right to make any corrections to prices quoted due to clerical errors or errors of omission. 9.6. No Refunds All amounts are non-refundable, non-cancellable and non-creditable. You agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable. 9.7. Overdue Charges If any invoiced amount is not received by ERP.net by the due date, then without limiting ERP.net’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) ERP.net may condition future renewals and Subscription Orders on payment terms, shorter than those specified in this section. 9.8. Suspension of Service and Acceleration If any charge owing by Customer under this or any other Agreement for Services is 30 days or more overdue, (or 10 or more days overdue in the case of amounts Customer has authorized ERP.net to charge to Customer’s bank card), ERP.net may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee obligations under such Agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until such amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for Customers paying by credit card or direct debit whose payment has been declined, ERP.net will give Customer at least 10 days prior notice that its account is overdue before suspending services to Customer. 9.8.1. Payment Disputes ERP.net will not exercise its rights in the sections above if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. 9.9. Fees Customer will pay all Fees specified in Subscription Orders. Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Subscription Order, (i) Fees are based on Purchased Services and the chosen Billing Models, and (ii) payment obligations are non-cancellable and Fees paid are non-refundable. Customer will pay the Fees applicable to the Purchased Services and the Billing Models (“License Fees”) and any other Fees, including but not limited to Fees relating to currency conversion, bank charges, transfer charges and any related payment transaction charges (“Transaction Fees”), and any Fees relating to your purchase or use of any services such as App, Marketplace purchases, or Third-Party Services (“Additional Fees”). License Fees are paid based on the applicable Billing Models and will be billed in as stated in Section 9.3 – Pricing and Payment. Transaction Fees and Additional Fees will be charged from time to time at ERP.net’s discretion. You will be charged at the beginning of each Billing Period for all outstanding Fees that have not previously been charged. Fees will appear on an invoice, which will be sent to the Customer and Administrator. 9.10. Resellers If you make any purchases through an authorized partner or reseller of ERP.net (“Reseller”), instead of paying ERP.net, you will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between you and the Reseller. We may suspend or terminate your rights to use Cloud Services if we do not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller. Your order details (e.g., the Cloud Services you are entitled to use, the number of Users, the Billing Period, etc.) will be as stated in the Subscription Order placed with us by the Reseller on your behalf, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Subscription Order as communicated to us. If you are entitled to a refund under this Agreement, then unless we otherwise specify, we will refund any applicable Fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to you. Resellers are not authorized to modify this Agreement or make any promises or commitments on our behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth. The amount paid or payable by the Reseller to us for your use of the applicable Cloud Services under this Agreement will be deemed the amount actually paid or payable by you to us under this Agreement for purposes of calculating the liability cap. 9.11. No contingencies on other products of future functionality You acknowledge that the Cloud Services and Additional Services referenced in a Subscription Order are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services. Payment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other services (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Services and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Subscription Order). You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Services beyond the duration of this Agreement), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features. 10. Tax Fees and other charges imposed under a Subscription Order will not include taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”), all of which will be for Customer’s account. Customer is responsible for all taxes, other than ERP.net’s income and payroll taxes. Customer must provide to ERP.net any direct pay permits or valid tax-exempt certificates prior to signing a Subscription Order. If ERP.net has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, ERP.net will invoice Customer and they will pay that amount unless Customer provides ERP.net with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, ERP.net is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property and employees. 10.1. Withholding Taxes You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes. You and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available. If we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof. You will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted. 11. Termination and Cancellations 11.1. Termination 11.1.1. Termination for Cause Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Subscription Orders) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after notice; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If a Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with this Section, ERP.net will refund the Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Billing Period after the effective date of termination. If ERP.net terminates this Agreement in accordance with this Section, ERP.net will retain any prepaid fees under the Subscription Billing Model and Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering past usage under the Usage Billing Model. 11.1.2. Termination for Convenience This Agreement will terminate: (i) Upon receipt of a written notice by the Customer to ERP.net that the Customer wishes to terminate the Agreement, at any time and for any reason; (ii) Upon the ‘Contract End Date’ in the applicable Subscription Order, if such is specified therein. Upon any such termination (i) you will not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees and (ii) if you have not already paid all applicable fees for the then-current Billing Period (for example, fees covering past usage under the Usage Billing Model or additional fees for an increase in Services), any such fees that are outstanding will become immediately due and payable. 11.2. Consequence of termination Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, you must cease using all Cloud Services and delete (or at our request, return) all Confidential Information or other materials of ours in your possession, including on any third-party systems operated on your behalf. You will certify such deletion upon our request. You will not have access to Your Data (and we may delete all of Your Data unless legally prohibited) after the termination of this Agreement, so you should make sure to export Your Data using the functionality of the Cloud Services while the Agreement is in force. In no event will termination relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination. Except where an exclusive remedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise. 11.3. Survival The following provisions will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms: Sections 4.2. (Responsibilities), 4.3 (Security), 5.3 (Responsibility for Users), 6.3 (Third-Party Developers), 7 (Use and restriction of the platform), 8 (Privacy and information), 9.5 (No refunds), 9.6 (Overdue Charges),9.8 (Fees), 12 (Liability and indemnities), 14 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction). 12.

Our sole liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, for any breach of the Warranty are set forth in this Section. 12.1.4. Warranty disclaimer EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 6.1 (SYSTEM AVAILABILITY), ALL CLOUD SERVICES AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, FUNCTIONALITY OR MERCHANTABILITY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION WILL APPLY WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY BUT WILL NOT LIMIT CUSTOMER'S AND ITS AFFILIATES’ PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS. 12.2.2 Exclusion of Consequential and Related Damages IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, GOODWILL, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF A PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF A PARTY’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ REMEDY OTHERWISE FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW. 12.2.3. IP Indemnification We will defend you against any claim brought against you by a third party alleging that the Cloud Services, when used as authorized under these Agreement, infringe any third-party patent, copyright or trademark, or misappropriates any third-party trade secret enforceable in any jurisdiction that is a signatory to the Berne Convention (a “Claim”), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded on the Claim by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to via settlement executed by us (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of the Claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice); (b) reasonable assistance in the defence and investigation of the Claim, including providing us a copy of the Claim, all relevant evidence in your possession, custody, or control, and cooperation with evidentiary discovery, litigation, and trial, including making witnesses within your employ or control available for testimony; and (c) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defence, and settlement (if applicable) of the Claim.

All the definitions used in the Platform’s Terms of Use are valid in this DPA, unless otherwise stated. Hereinafter the Data Controller, or just Controller, is the Customer under the Platform’s Terms of Use. The Customer will be called a Controller even in cases where it’s not a Controller under the definition of GDPR of the personal data being processed. And ERP.net Corporation Ltd, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively \"ERP.net\") hereinafter will be referred to as: the “Data Processor”. HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS: 1. Subject matter of this Data Processing Agreement 1.1. This Data Processing Agreement applies to the processing of personal data subject to EU Data Protection Law in the scope of the agreement of between the parties for the provision of services relating to the Data Controller’s use of ERP.net’s Cloud Services, Support Services and Professional Servies on the erp.net platform as outlined in Section 3.1 of the Platform Terms Of Use (“Services”) (hereinafter to be referred to as: the “Service Agreement”) 1.2. The term EU Data Protection Law shall mean Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) 1.3. Any capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Data Processing Agreement shall have the meaning given to them in the Service Agreement. Except as modified below, the terms of the Service Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Other terms used in this Data Processing Agreement that have meanings ascribed to them in the EU Data Protection law, including but not limited to “Processing”, “Personal Data”, “Data Controller” and “Processor,” shall carry the meanings set forth under EU Data Protection Law. 1.4. Insofar as the Data Processor will be processing Personal Data subject to EU Data Protection Law on behalf of the Data Controller in the course of the performance of the Service Agreement with the Data Controller, the terms of this Data Processing Agreement shall apply. In the event of a conflict between any provisions of the Service Agreement and the provisions of this Data Processing Agreement, the provisions of this Data Processing Agreement shall govern and control. An overview of the categories of Personal Data, the categories of Data Subjects, and the nature and purposes for which the Personal Data are being processed is provided in Appendix 2. 2. The Data Controller and the Data Processor 2.1. Subject to the provisions of the Service Agreement, to the extent that the Data Processor’s data processing activities are not adequately described in the Service Agreement, the Data Controller will determine the scope, purposes, and manner by which the Personal Data may be accessed or processed by the Data Processor. The Data Processor will process the Personal Data only as set forth in Data Controller’s written instructions and no Personal Data will be processed unless explicitly instructed by the Controller. 2.2. The Data Processor will only process the Personal Data on documented instructions of the Data Controller to the extent that this is required for the provision of the Services. Should the Data Processor reasonably believe that a specific processing activity beyond the scope of the Data Controller’s instructions is required to comply with a legal obligation to which the Data Processor is subject, the Data Processor shall inform the Data Controller of that legal obligation and seek explicit authorization from the Data Controller before undertaking such processing. The Data Processor shall never process the Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Data Controller’s documented instructions. The Data Processor shall immediately notify the Data Controller if, in its opinion, any instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection provisions. Such notification will not constitute a general obligation on the part of the Data Processor to monitor or interpret the laws applicable to the Data Controller, and such notification will not constitute legal advice to the Data Controller. 2.3. The Parties have entered into a Service Agreement in order to benefit from the capabilities of the Processor in securing and processing the Personal Data for the purposes set out in Annex 2. The Data Processor shall be allowed to exercise its own discretion in the selection and use of such means as it considers necessary to pursue those purposes, provided that all such discretion is compatible with the requirements of this Data Processing Agreement, in particular the Data Controller’s written instructions. 2.4. The Data Controller warrants that it has all necessary rights to provide the Personal Data to the Data Processor for the Processing to be performed in relation to the Services, and that one or more lawful bases set forth in EU Data Protection Law support the lawfulness of the Processing. To the extent required by EU Data Protection Law, the Data Controller is responsible for ensuring that all necessary privacy notices are provided to data subjects, and unless another legal basis set forth in EU Data Protection Law supports the lawfulness of the processing, that any necessary data subject consents to the Processing are obtained, and for ensuring that a record of such consents is maintained. Should such a consent be revoked by a data subject, the Data Controller is responsible for communicating the fact of such revocation to the Data Processor, and the Data Processor remains responsible for implementing Data Controller’s instruction with respect to the processing of that Personal Data. 3. Confidentiality 3.1. Without prejudice to any existing contractual arrangements between the Parties, the Data Processor shall treat all Personal Data as confidential and it shall inform all its employees, agents and/ or approved sub-processors engaged in processing the Personal Data of the confidential nature of the Personal Data. The Data Processor shall ensure that all such persons or parties have signed an appropriate confidentiality agreement, are otherwise bound to a duty of confidentiality, or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality. 3.2. Except where Applicable Data Protection Law provides otherwise, Processor shall keep a record of any Disclosure that is made for a minimum period of six months, including, but not limited to: (a) the name and address of the Third Party to which Personal Data were disclosed; (b) Personal Data which were disclosed; (c) date and time on which Personal Data were disclosed; and (d) the purpose of the disclosure. 3.3. Processor shall provide its employees access to Personal Data only to the extent necessary to perform the Processing. Processor shall ensure that any employee it authorises to have access to Personal Data Processed on behalf of Processor respects and maintains the confidentiality and security of the Personal Data. 4. Security 4.1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the Data Controller and Data Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security of the processing of Personal Data appropriate to the risk. These measures shall include, at a minimum, the security measures agreed upon by the Parties in Annex 3. 4.2. Both the Data Controller and the Data Processor shall maintain written security policies that are fully implemented and applicable to the processing of Personal Data. At a minimum, such policies should include assignment of internal responsibility for information security management, devoting adequate personnel resources to information security, carrying out verification checks on permanent staff who will have access to the Personal Data, conducting appropriate background checks, requiring employees, vendors and others with access to Personal Data to enter into written confidentiality agreements, and conducting training to make employees and others with access to the Personal Data aware of information security risks presented by the Processing. 4.3. Processor shall make available to Data Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Annex. Such information will in any case include necessary information on (i) the security measures as described in Appendix 3 of this Annex, (ii) any Sub-Processor (including copies of the agreements with those Sub-Processors), (iii) Data Security Breaches, (iv) return or deletion of Personal Data, (v) international data transfers and the safeguards taken to address transfer restrictions and (vi) measures in place to allow Data Controller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement. 4.4. The Data Processor’s adherence to either an approved code of conduct or to an approved certification mechanism recognized under EU Data Protection Law may be used as an element by which the Data Processor may demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in Article 4.1, provided that the requirements contained in Annex 3 are also addressed by such code of conduct or certification mechanism. 5. Improvements to Security 5.1. The Parties acknowledge that security requirements are constantly changing and that effective security requires frequent evaluation and regular improvements of outdated security measures. The Data Processor will therefore evaluate the measures as implemented in accordance with Article 4 on an on-going basis in order to maintain compliance with the requirements set out in Article 4. The Parties will negotiate in good faith the cost, if any, to implement material changes required by specific updated security requirements set forth in EU Data Protection Law or by data protection authorities of competent jurisdiction. 5.2. Where an amendment to the Service Agreement is necessary in order to execute a Data Controller instruction to the Data Processor to improve security measures as may be required by changes in EU Data Protection Law from time to time, the Parties shall negotiate an amendment to the Service Agreement in good faith. 6. Data Transfers 6.1. Upon the conclusion of this Data Processing Agreement, the Data Controller grants its authorisation to the Data Processor to transfer Personal Data to the sub-processors listed in the Data Processor’s List of Sub-processors. The Data Processor shall be obliged to provide the List of Sub-processors to the Data Controller upon a written request by the latter. The Data Proccessor shall promptly notify the Data Controller of any planned permanent or temporary transfers of Personal Data to a third country, including a country outside of the European Economic Area without an adequate level of protection. If the relevant sub-processor is not on the List of Sub-processors, the Data Processor shall only perform such a transfer after obtaining authorisation from the Data Controller, which may be refused at its own discretion. The Data Processor will only undertake such a transfer if it is strictly necessary for the performance of the Service, as outlined in Section 8.2.1. of the Terms of Use (Protection of Customer Data) and under the conditions therein. 6.2. Where a transfer of Personal data, subject to this Agreement, to a third country is necessary, the Data Processor shall be deemed to provide appropriate safeguards to protect the Personal data, including by virtue of making available Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent as a transfer mechanism. 6.3. To the extent that the Data Controller or the Data Processor are relying on a specific statutory mechanism to normalize international data transfers and that mechanism is subsequently modified, revoked, or held in a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the Data Controller and the Data Processor agree to cooperate in good faith to promptly suspend the transfer or to pursue a suitable alternate mechanism that can lawfully support the transfer. 7. Information Obligations and Incident Management 7.1. When the Data Processor becomes aware of an incident that has a material impact on the Processing of the Personal Data that is the subject of the Services Agreement, it shall promptly notify the Data Controller about the incident, shall at all times cooperate with the Data Controller, and shall follow the Data Controller’s instructions with regard to such incidents, in order to enable the Data Controller to perform a thorough investigation into the incident, to formulate a correct response, and to take suitable further steps in respect of the incident. 7.2.

The Data Processor shall at all times have in place written procedures which enable it to promptly respond to the Data Controller about an incident. Where the incident is reasonably likely to require a data breach notification by the Data Controller under EU Data Protection Law, the Data Processor shall implement its written procedures in such a way that it is in a position to notify the Data Controller without undue delay after the Data Processor becomes aware of such an incident. 7.4. Any notifications made to the Data Controller pursuant to this Article 7 shall be addressed to the employee of the Data Controller whose contact details are provided in Annex 1 of this Data Processing Agreement and, in order to assist the Data Controller in fulfilling its obligations under EU Data Protection Law, should contain: • a description of the nature of the incident, including where possible the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records concerned; • the name and contact details of the Data Processor’s data protection officer or another contact point where more information can be obtained; • a description of the likely consequences of the incident; and • a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the Data Processor to address the incident including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. 8. Contracting with Sub-Processors 8.1. The Data Processor shall not subcontract any of its Service-related activities consisting (partly) of the processing of the Personal Data or requiring Personal Data to be processed by any third party without the prior written authorisation of the Data Controller. 8.2. The Data Controller authorises the Data Processor to engage the sub-processors listed in the List of Sub-processors for the service-related Data Processing activities described in Annex 2. The Data Controller is obliged to provide the Data Controller with the List of Sub-processors upon the written request of the Data Controller. Data Processor shall inform the Data Controller of any addition or replacement of such sub-processors giving the Data Controller an opportunity to object to such changes. If the Data Controller timely sends the Processor a written objection notice, setting forth a reasonable basis for objection, the Parties will make a good-faith effort to resolve Data Controller’s objection. In the absence of a resolution, the Data Processor will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide Data Controller with the same level of service described in the Service Agreement, without using the sub-processor to process Data Controller’s Personal Data. If the Data Processor’s efforts are not successful within a reasonable time, each Party may terminate the portion of the service which cannot be provided without the sub-processor, and the Data Controller will be entitled to a pro-rated refund of the applicable service fees. 8.3. Notwithstanding any authorisation by the Data Controller within the meaning of the preceding paragraph, the Data Processor shall remain fully liable vis-à-vis the Data Controller for the performance of any such sub-processor that fails to fulfil its data protection obligations. 8.4. The Data Processor shall ensure that the sub-processor is bound by data protection obligations compatible with those of the Data Processor under this Data Processing Agreement, shall supervise compliance thereof, and must in particular impose on its sub-processors the obligation to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of EU Data Protection Law. 8.5. The Data Controller may request that the Data Processor audit a Third Party Sub-processor or provide confirmation that such an audit has occurred (or, where available, obtain or assist customer in obtaining a third-party audit report concerning the Third Party Sub-processor’s operations) to ensure compliance with its obligations imposed by the Data Processor in conformity with this Agreement. 9. Returning or Destruction of Personal Data 9.1. Upon termination of this Data Processing Agreement or upon the Data Controller’s written request, the process outlined in Section 8.2.5 of the Platform Terms of Use (Access to Customer Data) regarding the access to and destruction of the Personal Data shall be initiated. 9.2.

Dimo Gospodinov, Gospodinov@gglaw.bg Appendix 2 The Data Controller and Data Processor recognise that the Data Controller may order a wide variety of personal data relating to Enterprise Resource Planning to be processed. As such, it would not be feasible to outline beforehand all the Data Subjects and categories of Personal Data of said Data Subjects which will be processed. Below are listed most of the types of personal data which will be processed by the Data Processor, and the relevant Data Subjects. Types of Personal Data that will be processed in the scope of the Service Agreement: Personal contact information, including names, company name, e-mail addresses, physical addresses, and telephone numbers; HR data, such as employer’s name, title, salary, work obligations, and additional social benefits where applicable; Personal Data required for carrying out legal obligations to the social security system, and other employment data; Personal Data relating to education and professional qualifications. The Data Controller and Data Processor acknowledge that the special categories of Personal Data will be processed only if and to the extent that they are set out in the Agreement. Categories of Data Subjects: Customers of the Data Controller; Representatives of the Data Controller; Employees of the Data Controller; Suppliers of the Data Controller; Partners, collaborators, and other affiliates of the Data Controller. Nature and purpose of the Data Processing: The nature and purpose of the Data Processing shall be to carry out the Data Processor’s obligations under Section 3.1. of the Platform Terms of Use. These obligations shall vary depending on the specific services agree upon by the Data Controller and Data Processor. In particular, the processing operations shall consist of: storing Personal Data pertaining to customers, representatives, employees, suppliers, partners, collaborators, and other affiliates of the Data Controller; retrieving and making such data available to the Data Controller; carrying out the instructions of the Data Controller and performing computing operations on the Personal Data; where applicable, transferring said Personal Data to other EEA Member-States and third countries; and under the conditions of this Agreement, deleting said Personal Data. Appendix 3: Security Measures Data Processor shall: ensure that the Personal Data can be accessed only by authorized personnel for the purposes set forth in Annex 2 of this Data Processing Agreement; take all reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to the Personal Data through the use of appropriate physical and logical (passwords) entry controls, securing areas for data processing, and implementing procedures for monitoring the use of data processing facilities; build in system and audit trails; use secure passwords, network intrusion detection technology, encryption and authentication technology, secure logon procedures and virus protection; account for all the risks that are presented by processing, for example from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration, unauthorized or unlawful storage, processing, access or disclosure of Personal Data; ensure pseudonymisation and/or encryption of Personal Data, where appropriate; maintain the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; maintain the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; implement a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing of Personal Data; monitor compliance on an ongoing basis; implement measures to identify vulnerabilities with regard to the processing of Personal Data in systems used to provide services to the Data Controller; provide employee and contractor training to ensure ongoing capabilities to carry out the security measures established in policy. Personnel and Confidentiality Data Processor shall take reasonable steps to ensure that no person shall be appointed by Data Processor to process Personal Data unless that person: is competent and qualified to perform the specific tasks assigned to him by Data Processor; has been authorised by Data Processor; and has been instructed by Data Processor in the requirements relevant to the performance of the obligations of Data Processor under these Clauses, in particular the limited purpose of the data processing. Data Processor personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. Data Processor conducts reasonably appropriate backgrounds checks to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and statutory regulations. Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge receipt of, and compliance with, Data Processor’s confidentiality and privacy policies. They are provided with training and personnel handling Customer Data are required to complete additional requirements appropriate to their role. Physical Security Data Processor uses geographically distributed data centers and stores all production data in physically secure data centers. Data Processor Sub-processor’s production data centres employ measures to secure the access to data processing systems. They have an access system that controls access to the data center. This system permits only authorised personnel to have access to secure areas. The facilities are designed to withstand adverse weather and other reasonably predictable natural conditions, are secured by around-the-clock guards, CCTV monitoring, access screening and escort-controlled access, and are also supported by on-site back-up generators in the event of a power failure. The data center electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and maintainable without impact to continuous 24/7 operations. In most cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source is provided for critical infrastructure components in the data center. Backup power is provided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) batteries or diesel generators which are capable to provide emergency electrical power supply or reliable power protection during utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of failure and minimize the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Data Processor Sub-processor’s production equipment and facilities have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the process for and frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer’s or internal specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the data center equipment is scheduled through a standard change process according to documented procedures. System Access Control Data Processor servers use a Linux based implementation customized for the Services. Data Processor employs a review process to increase the security of the operating systems used to provide the Services and enhance the security products in production environments. Data Processor has, and maintains, a security policy for the personnel. Data Processor infrastructure, development and support personnel are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of Data Processor’s security of the infrastructure, the review of the Services, and responding to security incidents. Data Processor’s internal access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorized persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process customer data, including personal data. Data Processor aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorized persons to access data they are authorized to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during processing, use and after recording. Data Processor employs an access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to authorized personnel. The following may, among other controls, be applied depending upon the particular Services ordered: authentication via passwords and/or two-factor authentication, SSH keys, authorization processes, change management processes, logical access to the data centers is restricted and protected by firewall/VLAN and logging of access on several levels. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; and a need to know basis. The granting or modification of access rights must also be in accordance with Data Processor’s internal data access policies. Services Access Control Customer and End Users must authenticate themselves via an authentication system in order to use the Services. Each application checks credentials in order to allow the display of data to an authorized End User. The following may, among other controls, be applied depending upon the particular Services ordered: authentication via passwords and/or two-factor authentication, SSH keys, authorization processes, change management processes, and logging of access on several levels. Depending upon the particular Services ordered the following controls may also apply: unique identifiers are attributed to the responsible individual, revoke access mechanisms on consecutive failed login attempts and lockout time periods, password expiry and reset mechanisms, password complexity requirements. Data Access Control Data Processor stores data in a multi-tenant environment, meaning that multiple customers’ deployments are stored on the same physical hardware. Data Processor uses logical isolation to segregate each Customer’s data and logically separates each Customer’s data from that of others. This provides the scale while rigorously preventing customers from accessing one another’s data. Customer is given control over specific controls for sharing access to the data to End Users for specific purposes in accordance with the functionality of the Services. Customer may choose to make use of these controls. Data Processor makes available certain logging capability. Direct access to customer data is restricted and in case such is required access rights are established and enforced only to properly authorized staff in addition to the access control rules set forth in the previous Sections. Transmission Control Data centers are typically connected via high-speed private links to provide secure and fast data transfer between data centers. This is designed to prevent data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during electronic transfer or transport or while being recorded onto data storage media or exchanged within the data center. For data in transit, Data Processor uses industry standard transport protocols such as SSL and TLS between Customer devices and Data Processor’s Services and data centers, and within data centers themselves. Except as otherwise specified for the Services (including within the Order, the applicable Agreement or the User documentation of the Services), transmissions of data outside the Service environment are encrypted. Some functionalities of the Services may enable the Customer to choose unencrypted communications in their use of the Service. Customer is solely responsible for the results of its decision to use such unencrypted communications or transmissions. Input Control The Personal Data source is under the control of the Customer, and Personal Data integration into the system, is managed by secured file transfer, via web services or entered into the application from the Customer. As set forth in Section Transmission Control above, some functionalities of the Services permit Customers to use unencrypted file transfer protocols. In such cases, Customer is solely responsible for its decision to use such unencrypted field transfer protocols. The Services will not introduce any viruses to Customer Data; however, the Services do not scan for viruses that could be included in attachments or other Personal Data uploaded into the Services by Customer. Any such uploaded attachments will not be executed in the Services and therefore will not damage or compromise the Service. Network Control Data Processor blocks unauthorized traffic to and within the data centers using a variety of technologies such as firewalls, NATs, partitioned Local Area Networks and physical separation of back-end servers from public-facing interfaces. Data Processor employs multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Data Processor considers potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external facing systems. Data Processor and authorized personnel will monitor the Services for unauthorised intrusions using network-based intrusion detection mechanisms. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Data Processor’s intrusion detection involves tightly controlling the network communication attack surface through preventative measures such as firewalls, employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points and employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations. Incident Response Data Processor maintains security incident management policies and procedures and monitors a variety of communication channels for security incidents. Data Processor personnel will react promptly to known incidents and will promptly notify Customer in the event Data Processor becomes aware of an actual or reasonably suspected unauthorised disclosure of Personal Data. System Logs Data Processor ensures that processing systems used to store Customer Data log information to their respective system log facility. Log entries are maintained in case there is suspicion of inappropriate access and an analysis is required. Logging is kept securely to prevent tampering. Reliability and Backup For the Services, Data Processor ensures that backups are taken on a regular basis. Backups are secured using a combination of technical and physical controls. Data Processor ensures that the systems where Customer Data is stored have a disaster recovery facility and are governed under disaster recovery plan. In the event production facilities are to be rendered unavailable, Data Processor will execute recovery plans to restore operation in timely manner. Data Processor has designed and regularly plans and tests its disaster recovery plans. Data destruction When customers delete data or leave the Service, Data Processor ensures the data is deleted as per the terms in the applicable Agreement. For certain disks Data Processor follows strict rigorous standards that call for overwriting storage resources before reuse, as well as physically disposing of decommissioned hardware. Data Processor Sub-processor’s production data centres employs strict procedures for reuse, redeployment, data destruction and decommission of disks and hardware. Subprocessor Security Before onboarding Sub-processors, Data Processor conducts an audit of the security and privacy practices of Sub-processors to ensure Sub-processors provide a level of security and privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope of the services they are engaged to provide. The Sub-processor is required to enter into appropriate security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms. System Changes and Enhancements Data Processor may enhance and implement changes in the Services during the term of the Agreement. Security controls, procedures, policies and features may change or be added. Data Processor will provide security controls that deliver a level of security protection that is not materially lower than that provided as of the Effective Date."
