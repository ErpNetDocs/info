Accounting information can be integrated and presented visually in other modules of the ERP system, and together with subsystem Finance financial and accounting management align more closely. Integration Module Accounting is fully integrated with the main system and changes in other modules are automatically reflected in the accounting records. This eliminates double data entry, saving time and costs. Automation The module automates various processes, such as creating accounting entries and all document types, currency revaluation, calculation of depreciation of assets, revaluation of receivables from customers and payables to suppliers, and finalization of accounts. With the module, economic transactions are accounted for under preset templates. Accounting templates are a mechanism to indicate the system how to account for primary documents. They also allow you to define common operations in order to facilitate and accelerate entering accounting information. The creation of an accounting template requires setting a sequence of operations. In each operation, it is defined where to take a sum from and which account to put it in. Accounting templates are a very important tool to achieve maximum automation of labor. After the initial setup by an accountant, they allow you to distribute the tasks for entering primary data between accountants and people performing business transactions. The module also allows adding dimensions in one account, modeling dimensions and automatic accounting operations, and connecting dimensions with data from operational documents. In addition, you can use it to make references by dimensions and combine them. Individual chart of accounts Module Accounting allows the creation of an individual chart of accounts.

This facilitates the analysis of financial results and making management decisions. Categorisation of revenue and expenditure In module Accounting, you can enter and use the centers of revenue and expenditure to categorize income and expenses for accounting and management purposes by departments.

They treats costs in different ways. ERP.net allows you to use two charts of accounts simultaneously when entering primary accounting documents. Thus, as early as during the implementation of the system, you can set a management breakdown of costs and your own requirements for data visualization without interfering with accounting or tax requirements and regulations. This way the management will be able to get the necessary financial and accounting information without help from the accounting department. Attaching documents to accounting ERP.net also allows you to attach invoices, payment orders and other primary documents to accounting. This saves time in searching for information in the archives and allows the management to make quick references on the details of accounting documents. This functionality is especially useful when performing accounting and internal company audits."

It facilitates and optimizes warehouse employees’ work with the ERP system. Warehouse entrance and exit control The module provides a single point of receipt of warehouse orders, whose execution is controlled by barcode readers. The control covers both revenue and expenditure warehouse operations to ensure up to date information on stocks. The verification process by barcode readers is carried out after products have already been collected and moved to the checking place. An employee opens a special form in the system designed for implementation monitoring. The data in the form is filtered by order number or addressee. Then the product check with a barcode reader begins. Timely warning The module can find discrepancies between a scanned item and the documented information about it. It automatically triggers an audible and visual alarm. If there is an attempt to register an amount which is larger than the actual order, the system displays an error message accompanied by an audible signal. In case the registered amount is lower than the order, the corresponding line turns red so that it gets checked by an employee who can see if this is a mistake or the product is not available. After verification, the module automatically generates a warehouse receipt for the amount, which is a signal to check out the goods from the warehouse. Facilities at work To avoid the need to use a keyboard, there is an option for the printed orders to feature a barcode for the document number. An additional convenience is the option to print out a list of barcodes for different amounts that can be scanned when an order includes several identical items. For example, an employee first scans the barcode of “10x” from the list and then the product itself. The aim is to avoid repeated scanning of products which are the same."

It offers very convenient tools to graphically represent production programs. You can make daily adjustments to the production plan with just a few clicks, and the edited operation moves to another day or hour. How does CRP work? When a new product for manufacturing is entered in the system, It needs to be assigned a production technology which defines the machines and the length of processing it is supposed to go through. In order for the production technology to be described, the system needs to have information about the available resources (machines) and their production capacity. When the system calculates a production schedule, it checks the needs of all products and tries to match them with the available resources. The system sorts orders according by priority and monitors production deadlines. If there is a problem that interferes with the time limit, the system will warn you and mark the order in red, so you can check it and decide how to proceed. Although the system can automatically calculate production schedules, the final decision is yours. You can approve a schedule or modify it. It is often necessary to implement emergency orders, which rearranges the approved plan. To avoid this situation, production management theory recommends to plan a resource load of 75% -95%, depending on manufacturing specifics and batch sizes, but never 100%. Capacity requirements planning requires efforts – you need to enter information about you resources, technologies and products in advance. But this work will pay off because ERP.net CRP will drastically increase the efficiency and effectiveness of your employees in charge of planning."

Together, the production modules of ERP.net bring significant advantages to the companies in the sector. The ERP system features powerful tools for material planning, scheduling and monitoring of production capacity load. It also allows for each item to be assigned specific recipes and principal recipes and facilitates the management of complex manufacturing processes. ERP.net Production has a capacity planning module which turns the complex task of planning and continuously updating production schedules into quite an easy and affordable activity. The material planning module provides industrial units with the necessary products and materials at the right time and the right place. There is also a specific production module to manage the core of manufacturing. It creates production orders, to monitor inputs, are taken into consideration the activities and the resulting end products. In addition, the modules are integrated with a unique tool that allows businesses to easily create and cost estimate new products and categories. New product models can be easily configured according to customer requirements, no matter how complex and specific they are. Modules ERP.net Production consists of 4 main modules: Product technologies - it enables the manufacturer to form the components of each item and the operational steps and supports multiple recipes for a single product type Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP) - it monitors the percentage load of manufacturing resources, the scheduling of production activities, and Gantt charts Material Requirements Planning (MRP) - it takes care of production planning and supply Shop Floor Control (SFC) - it manages the core manufacturing process.

    "keywords": "Material Requirements Planning The main purpose of module Material requirements planning (MRP), together with subsystem Logistics, in ERP.net is to provide products and materials at the right time, the right place. The module is meant to maintain a smooth logistics process based on formulations, technology, orders from customers and to suppliers, inventory, sales projections, etc. In case of shortage of a raw material, semi-finished or finished product, the system alerts the relevant staff and offers supply suggestions which can be approved with one click. Integration with other modules in the system The MRP module, together with subsystem Logistics, provides all necessary means to completely cover the logistics process in any business. Control of supplies planned by the system In case of shortage of a raw material, semi-finished or finished product, the system alerts the relevant staff and offers supply suggestions which can be approved with one click. Planning methods supported by the system Shortfall products can be obtained in several ways: In-house production CMT production from an external counterparty Purchase Transfer from another warehouse The module can support a preferred method of planning for each product. The system supports both centralized and decentralized planning. For example, you can set the module to offer purchase from a supplier in case of shortage in the central warehouse, while deficits in other warehouses can trigger a suggestion to transfer from the central one. There is also one more option – if there is a shortage in any warehouse, a purchase from an external supplier can be planned. The quantity dimension of any shortfall can be calculated by several methods: Minimum availability – if availability falls below a certain minimum amount, the system suggests an order to reach back the target value. Calculating MRP – this method calculates the exact amount which is necessary for the planning period. Economic order – comparing the cost for preparing and and transportation of an order to the cost of storing these goods in a warehouse. At regular intervals – this method offers to order the quantity consumed during the previous interval. Once you precise amount, the system can adjust it to meet certain criteria. The criteria that the system supports are: Batch size – with this criterion, orders are always multiples of the given size. Minimum/maximum – the supplier may require a minimum (more often) or a maximum amount of an order. Using the given methods and criteria, the system calculates and suggests an order. The final decision on the confirmation or modification of the suggestion, however, is taken by an employee working with the program. You must keep in mind that accurate supply operations require the following subsystems to also function with a high level of precision: Inventory management – if inventory data is not up-to-date and real-time, the supply system may generate inaccurate order suggestions. Sales projections – projections of future sales are not mandatory but can contribute to the optimization of supply suggestions. Customer orders – they reveal the real-life demand for finished products, and if they are not entered correctly, supply will give inaccurate suggestions. Recipes in manufacturing – they are used to decompose the needs for finished products to needs for materials or manufactured products. If recipes are not true, it will lead to erroneous suggestions for supply. Document types The module works with several document types that cover the entire supply process: Transfer order – for the transfer of goods from a warehouse/storage space to another warehouse/storage space. Replenishment order – this is an order that addresses the need for products in a warehouse. It can come from different departments and is created by demand, with specifying a * supplier and prices not being obligatory. Such an order is processed by the Supply Department, which then uses it to generate a purchase order. Purchase order – such an order can be proposed by the system (document status: Planned) or made manually. It indicates an intention to buy a product from a specific provider, at a certain (optional) price. Receiving order – this type of document provides input control over supplies and a comparison between the ordered goods, the received goods and the invoice – the so-called “triple-check.” Module Material planning has high requirements to function properly but the benefits it brings are many times more than the efforts for its implementation. With this module, you can have more timely dispatches and optimize inventory and the time to process an order. The module is suitable for use by both manufacturing and distribution companies. One solution for the entire organization ERP.net is a solution that can cover all key business processes in your company. It does not matter whether the individual modules are implemented simultaneously or added at a later stage, they will always be fully integrated. You can use the accumulated data from all modules to make detailed reports that let you analyze your results in detail and prepare budgets and projections for future periods."

When creating a technological route, each operation is assigned a main resource (work center) where it is performed, as well as specific duration and other parameters that define the production process in detail. Each operation is associated with the relevant, to-be-processed materials (components) of the final product, as well as the production resources and tools used in the operation. On the back of this information, the system facilitates planning of the production process. It can automatically suggest a plan that takes into account the necessary materials.

    "keywords": "Hosting & Reliability Q&A High Availability & Monitoring Does the ERP.net service feature high availability? Yes. There are many components in an ERP instance - database, application servers, web servers, apps, reverse proxy, process manager, etc. Each component is hosted on a hardware, which is always having a stand-by backup hardware, ready to take over in a case of a hardware failure. All network components are also stacked for high availability. Each network component is cross-connected to each host. The point is, there is no single point of failure. Is the system monitored at all times? Yes. There is a dedicated team, monitoring all systems 24x7x365. In case of an issue, reaction time is usually in the 5-15 minutes range, day and night. What happens in case of a hardware problem? The most important part is the problem to be automatically detected by the watchdog systems. Once the problem is detected, an automatic failover occurs. The failover is usually within 30-60 seconds. Most of the time, the users might notice just a slight delay in their processing. What is the reaction time in case of an issue? First of all, most issues auto-resolve themselves, because each component has high-availability and the workload is automatically transferred to another node. However, should it reach to a human intervention, the reaction time usually is within 5-15 minutes, day and night, 24x7x365. Is the system monitored from outside? Yes. There are at least two different locations, usually in different countries or states, which has automatic watchdogs setup. Each alarm for non-availability is reviewed by human operators. Disaster Recovery & Backups Are there backups of my data? Yes. We hope you are joking and this is a rhetorical question 🙂. Seriously, the backup planning, execution and control is one of most important activities out there. You can read more about backups in the Disaster Recovery section. Is the off-site backup included in the price? Yes. The off-site backup is included in the price for all subscription levels. You do not need to do anything in order to be fully protected. Miscellaneous What hardware is used for the service? There are a lot of moving parts in a proper ERP service. Reliability is the most important factor when choosing the correct hardware. Performance comes second, but is also of paramount importance. It is hard to describe all hardware, but here are some quick facts: Database servers: Top of the line, data center grade, specialized frequency optimized CPU. These usually cost around 10 times more per core than regular CPUs. 32 GB RAM per core. Optane SSD drives for caching and temp db. NVMe SSDs for databases. 2 x 100 Gbit network to stand-by server. 4 x 10 Gbit network connection to application servers. Application servers: Enterprise grade general-purpose CPU for application processing. 4 GB RAM per application core. SSDs for storage. 2 x 10 Gbit/s network connection Network components: Enterprise grade Cisco routers, switches and firewalls. What database size to expect? Database sizes vary depending on many factors: Regular user processing. Automation by applications. Storage of documents, pictures, etc. Use of Track Changes feature. etc. We can only try to predict, with big tolerance for error, the regular user processing. As a rule of thumb, each user generates approximately between 0.25 and 1.00 GB of data per year."
