This eliminates double data entry, saving time and costs. Automation The module automates various processes, such as creating accounting entries and all document types, currency revaluation, calculation of depreciation of assets, revaluation of receivables from customers and payables to suppliers, and finalization of accounts. With the module, economic transactions are accounted for under preset templates. Accounting templates are a mechanism to indicate the system how to account for primary documents. They also allow you to define common operations in order to facilitate and accelerate entering accounting information. The creation of an accounting template requires setting a sequence of operations. In each operation, it is defined where to take a sum from and which account to put it in. Accounting templates are a very important tool to achieve maximum automation of labor. After the initial setup by an accountant, they allow you to distribute the tasks for entering primary data between accountants and people performing business transactions.

When the value of a calculated attribute is requested, it is calculated \"on the fly\", in real time. Note Calculated attribute formulas are compiled to native executable format. Their calculation speed is very similar to the speed of the system defined calculated attributes. Example - Get default payment term days Suppose, that in a Sales Order, we want to display the customers default payment term (in days). In the Sales Order, we can define the following Calculated Attribute: No Operation Param1 Param2 Param3 10 GETREF REF:Customer ATTRIB:DefaultPaymentTermDays Explanation: GETREF - gets information from a related entity. The related entity is specified in Param1. The desired information is specified in Param2. Line number 10 is the only line in the calculated attribute The return value is the value of the attribute DefaultPaymentTermDays in the Customer entity. Example - Complex filter and summation The following calculated attribute sums all sales order lines, whose product: has a user data attribute, called \"CustPropPrj\", equal to '500' has a Name, containing the word 'Tool' No Operation Param1 Param2 Param3 10 SUM EXP:20 ATTRIB:LineAmount 20 FILTER CHILD:Lines EXP:30 30 IN ATTRIB:Product EXP:40 40 FILTER QUERY:Gen_Products EXP:50 50 AND EXP:60 EXP:70 60 EQUALS ATTRIB:CustPropPrj CONST:500 70 LIKE ATTRIB:Name CONST:'Tool' Explanation: Line 10: Iterates through the data set, specified on Line 20 (EXP:20), then SUMs the attribute LineAmount. Line 20: Filters the Lines subset with the filter, specified in Line 30 (EXP:30). Line 30: Creates a filter, which will be satisfied only by products, specified in the query on Line 40 (EXP:40). Line 40: Creates a query, which filters the products with the condition, specified on Line 50. Line 50: Specifies that the condition is comprised of two conditions, linked with AND. Line 60: Specifies that the first condition is the value of an attribute, called CustPropPrj should be 500.

For example, the Product Name of a Product can be entered in many languages simultaneously. When visualizing the data, the correct language version of the string is displayed automatically by the system, depending on the current user language. Note For reports, the report designer can specify whether to use the current user language or always use a fixed language. For example, for a Portuguese invoice, one would require that the labels and data are always displayed in Portuguese. Entering data in multiple languages The client applications of ERP.net usually allow the following abilities regarding multi-language strings: Enter the string in many languages Transliterate a string from one language to another (or all) Translate a string from one language to another (or all) When entering translations for a multi-language string, the client application usually displays a table with cells for each language translation, similar to this: Language Value EN: Toothpaste DE: Zahnpasta Depending on the client application, translation can sometimes also be automated. Some client applications support using an online service, like Google Translate to automatically translate a string to other languages. Translation is better suited to Description and Notes attributes. Transliteration Transliteration is the process of translating one language version of a string to another, based on the sounding of the string. Transliteration works great for person and company names and addresses. It allows branch offices to work in their local language and reports can still be shown in the corporate language. For example, the Russian word \"Иван\" would be transliterated in English as \"Ivan\". Transliteration works in two ways - manual and automatic. Manual transliteration \"Manual\" transliteration is actually automatic, but is initiated manually while editing the different language versions of a multi-language string. While editing multi-language string, the client application usually provides a function button, which transliterates the current language version to other languages. Automatic transliteration Automatic transliteration occurs when the system needs to display some a multi-language string in some language, but that specific language translation is not saved in the database. For example, suppose one employee works in a branch office in Russia and enters \"Иван\" as a person first name. The database saves only the Russian language version. Then another employee at a UK location requests to see the first name of the same person. The system would automatically transliterate the string and display it as \"Ivan\". Note Transliteration works optimally between Latin and Cyrillic."

It automatically triggers an audible and visual alarm. If there is an attempt to register an amount which is larger than the actual order, the system displays an error message accompanied by an audible signal. In case the registered amount is lower than the order, the corresponding line turns red so that it gets checked by an employee who can see if this is a mistake or the product is not available. After verification, the module automatically generates a warehouse receipt for the amount, which is a signal to check out the goods from the warehouse. Facilities at work To avoid the need to use a keyboard, there is an option for the printed orders to feature a barcode for the document number. An additional convenience is the option to print out a list of barcodes for different amounts that can be scanned when an order includes several identical items.

The solution provides a single point for receiving orders for performing warehouse operations, whether these are orders for shipment (from the CRM subsystem) requests for discharge of materials (from the Production subsystem) or transfer orders to another warehouse (from the supply module). Similarly, served are orders to receive purchased goods, logging in production and accepting products from other stores. The module provides a unified methodology for monitoring the implementation of warehouse orders, including alarms for delays and more. With the software, you can turn warehouses into a structure of storage locations. Storage locations can be roughly defined sections of the storage space or alternatively they can have a precise hierarchy with the position of each product. Thus, the module can provide navigated deployment and picking up of products from a warehouse. This means the system can direct warehouse workers to specific storage locations when they have to store new products or prepare goods for shipping. There are several methods to do this: Preparation by order — the navigation calculates the most economical route to the warehouse for the preparation of all products, order by order Group preparation by storage locations — the navigation indicates the shortest route for group preparation of several orders simultaneously The Warehouse Management Module also supports inventory planning, preparation and implementation. Inventory operations can be full or partial — by products or by storage spaces. In addition, the system can print out an inventory sheet which can be filled out by hand and then uploaded to a computer to check for discrepancies. In order to fully support warehouse operations, ERP.net comes with integrated support for barcode and RFID readers. This way you can use such devices in all warehouse operations. Input data for the implementation of warehouse activities can be sent from external systems — automated lines, palmtops, etc. This happens though a universal interface, which you can leverage to set up fully automated reporting of storage operations. In addition, the system also has built-in reporting features for planned and unplanned scraps. It is reported by reasons and can also be summed and analysed by reasons."

    "keywords": "Zone Based Routing The basic idea With Zone based routing, the rules for processing the goods are determined based on the zone, in which the goods are stored for each step. The zones are sequentially numbered, relative to their \"closeness\" to final shipping. For example: 1 IN -> 2 INSP -> 3 BULK -> 4 PICK -> 5 KIT -> 6 PACK -> 7 OUT RECEIVE ------------> --OPTIMIZE--> ----------------> DISPATCH The main processes in the warehouse - receive, optimize and dispatch, are ordered consecutively through the zone sequence. The receive process starts at the inbound docks and runs until goods are placed in bulk. The optimization process usually deals with replenishment of the picking zones, but can also be used for pre-kitting. The planning of the dispatch process works backwards - from the final step (the dispatch from the outbound docks) to the first step (usually picking). This is similar to how MRP/DRP works, but applied for WMS. Zone based routing and sequencing provides great flexibility in the route formation process, while keeping things simple and understandable for the process designers. It allows the process designers to focus separately on each zone, leaving the complex full routing formation to the system. Zone based routing allows programming of very complicated routes, while still keeping things simple and maintainable. How it works? For each zone, there are rules, which define how the goods will be processed, when they pass the zone. The rules for a zone are defined separately for each of the WMS processes - receive, dispatch and replenishment. The full route is the concatenation of all route steps for each consecutive zone. Hierarchical rules Since zones are hierarchical, for any given zone there might be multiple rules, coming from different levels of the hierarchy. All rules in the hierarchy are combined when creating the routing. Combining the rules is performed separately for each STEP NO within each zone. To determine the \"winning\" rule for each step, the RULE PRIORITY is used within all rules, which satisfy the RULE CONDITIONs. Start and finish of the process The receive process starts at the inbound dock and is planned through the zones, until there are no more steps. Usually, it finishes at the BULK zone. The dispatch process works in the opposite way - it first determines the quantities needed at the outbound docks, and than determines what previous steps could supply these quantities. The optimization process is a middle ground - it just runs for all zones, for which there is a definition for the optimization process. Related topics: Zone-based routing examples"

It offers very convenient tools to graphically represent production programs. You can make daily adjustments to the production plan with just a few clicks, and the edited operation moves to another day or hour. How does CRP work? When a new product for manufacturing is entered in the system, It needs to be assigned a production technology which defines the machines and the length of processing it is supposed to go through. In order for the production technology to be described, the system needs to have information about the available resources (machines) and their production capacity. When the system calculates a production schedule, it checks the needs of all products and tries to match them with the available resources. The system sorts orders according by priority and monitors production deadlines. If there is a problem that interferes with the time limit, the system will warn you and mark the order in red, so you can check it and decide how to proceed. Although the system can automatically calculate production schedules, the final decision is yours. You can approve a schedule or modify it. It is often necessary to implement emergency orders, which rearranges the approved plan. To avoid this situation, production management theory recommends to plan a resource load of 75% -95%, depending on manufacturing specifics and batch sizes, but never 100%. Capacity requirements planning requires efforts – you need to enter information about you resources, technologies and products in advance. But this work will pay off because ERP.net CRP will drastically increase the efficiency and effectiveness of your employees in charge of planning."

Modules ERP.net Production consists of 4 main modules: Product technologies - it enables the manufacturer to form the components of each item and the operational steps and supports multiple recipes for a single product type Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP) - it monitors the percentage load of manufacturing resources, the scheduling of production activities, and Gantt charts Material Requirements Planning (MRP) - it takes care of production planning and supply Shop Floor Control (SFC) - it manages the core manufacturing process. In the module, the manufacturer can create production orders, monitor inputs, and make reports about activities (used materials and operations) and production"

    "keywords": "Material Requirements Planning The main purpose of module Material requirements planning (MRP), together with subsystem Logistics, in ERP.net is to provide products and materials at the right time, the right place. The module is meant to maintain a smooth logistics process based on formulations, technology, orders from customers and to suppliers, inventory, sales projections, etc. In case of shortage of a raw material, semi-finished or finished product, the system alerts the relevant staff and offers supply suggestions which can be approved with one click. Integration with other modules in the system The MRP module, together with subsystem Logistics, provides all necessary means to completely cover the logistics process in any business. Control of supplies planned by the system In case of shortage of a raw material, semi-finished or finished product, the system alerts the relevant staff and offers supply suggestions which can be approved with one click. Planning methods supported by the system Shortfall products can be obtained in several ways: In-house production CMT production from an external counterparty Purchase Transfer from another warehouse The module can support a preferred method of planning for each product. The system supports both centralized and decentralized planning. For example, you can set the module to offer purchase from a supplier in case of shortage in the central warehouse, while deficits in other warehouses can trigger a suggestion to transfer from the central one. There is also one more option – if there is a shortage in any warehouse, a purchase from an external supplier can be planned. The quantity dimension of any shortfall can be calculated by several methods: Minimum availability – if availability falls below a certain minimum amount, the system suggests an order to reach back the target value. Calculating MRP – this method calculates the exact amount which is necessary for the planning period. Economic order – comparing the cost for preparing and and transportation of an order to the cost of storing these goods in a warehouse. At regular intervals – this method offers to order the quantity consumed during the previous interval. Once you precise amount, the system can adjust it to meet certain criteria. The criteria that the system supports are: Batch size – with this criterion, orders are always multiples of the given size. Minimum/maximum – the supplier may require a minimum (more often) or a maximum amount of an order. Using the given methods and criteria, the system calculates and suggests an order. The final decision on the confirmation or modification of the suggestion, however, is taken by an employee working with the program. You must keep in mind that accurate supply operations require the following subsystems to also function with a high level of precision: Inventory management – if inventory data is not up-to-date and real-time, the supply system may generate inaccurate order suggestions. Sales projections – projections of future sales are not mandatory but can contribute to the optimization of supply suggestions. Customer orders – they reveal the real-life demand for finished products, and if they are not entered correctly, supply will give inaccurate suggestions. Recipes in manufacturing – they are used to decompose the needs for finished products to needs for materials or manufactured products. If recipes are not true, it will lead to erroneous suggestions for supply. Document types The module works with several document types that cover the entire supply process: Transfer order – for the transfer of goods from a warehouse/storage space to another warehouse/storage space. Replenishment order – this is an order that addresses the need for products in a warehouse. It can come from different departments and is created by demand, with specifying a * supplier and prices not being obligatory. Such an order is processed by the Supply Department, which then uses it to generate a purchase order. Purchase order – such an order can be proposed by the system (document status: Planned) or made manually. It indicates an intention to buy a product from a specific provider, at a certain (optional) price. Receiving order – this type of document provides input control over supplies and a comparison between the ordered goods, the received goods and the invoice – the so-called “triple-check.” Module Material planning has high requirements to function properly but the benefits it brings are many times more than the efforts for its implementation. With this module, you can have more timely dispatches and optimize inventory and the time to process an order. The module is suitable for use by both manufacturing and distribution companies. One solution for the entire organization ERP.net is a solution that can cover all key business processes in your company. It does not matter whether the individual modules are implemented simultaneously or added at a later stage, they will always be fully integrated. You can use the accumulated data from all modules to make detailed reports that let you analyze your results in detail and prepare budgets and projections for future periods."

When creating a technological route, each operation is assigned a main resource (work center) where it is performed, as well as specific duration and other parameters that define the production process in detail. Each operation is associated with the relevant, to-be-processed materials (components) of the final product, as well as the production resources and tools used in the operation. On the back of this information, the system facilitates planning of the production process. It can automatically suggest a plan that takes into account the necessary materials. The created technology serves as a template of materials in production reporting. In ERP.net, technology can be dynamically adjusted – when it is necessary to change interchangeable raw materials or products, as well as in case of changes in the amounts of utilized raw materials."

    "keywords": "Hosting & Reliability FAQ High Availability & Monitoring Does the ERP.net service feature high availability? Yes. There are many components in an ERP instance - database, application servers, web servers, apps, reverse proxy, process manager, etc. Each component is hosted on a hardware, which is always having a stand-by backup hardware, ready to take over in a case of a hardware failure. All network components are also stacked for high availability. Each network component is cross-connected to each host. The point is, there is no single point of failure. Is the system monitored at all times? Yes. There is a dedicated team, monitoring all systems 24x7x365. In case of an issue, reaction time is usually in the 5-15 minutes range, day and night. What happens in case of a hardware problem? The most important part is the problem to be automatically detected by the watchdog systems. Once the problem is detected, an automatic failover occurs. The failover is usually within 30-60 seconds. Most of the time, the users might notice just a slight delay in their processing. What is the reaction time in case of an issue? First of all, most issues auto-resolve themselves, because each component has high-availability and the workload is automatically transferred to another node. However, should it reach to a human intervention, the reaction time usually is within 5-15 minutes, day and night, 24x7x365. Is the system monitored from outside? Yes. There are at least two different locations, usually in different countries or states, which has automatic watchdogs setup. Each alarm for non-availability is reviewed by human operators. Disaster Recovery & Backups Are there backups of my data? Yes. We hope you are joking and this is a rhetorical question 🙂. Seriously, the backup planning, execution and control is one of most important activities out there. You can read more about backups in the Disaster Recovery section. Is the off-site backup included in the price? Yes. The off-site backup is included in the price for all subscription levels. You do not need to do anything in order to be fully protected. Miscellaneous What hardware is used for the service? There are a lot of moving parts in a proper ERP service. Reliability is the most important factor when choosing the correct hardware. Performance comes second, but is also of paramount importance. It is hard to describe all hardware, but here are some quick facts: Database servers: Top of the line, data center grade, specialized frequency optimized CPU. These usually cost around 10 times more per core than regular CPUs. 32 GB RAM per core. Optane SSD drives for caching and temp db. NVMe SSDs for databases. 2 x 100 Gbit network to stand-by server. 4 x 10 Gbit network connection to application servers. Application servers: Enterprise grade general-purpose CPU for application processing. 4 GB RAM per application core. SSDs for storage. 2 x 10 Gbit/s network connection Network components: Enterprise grade Cisco routers, switches and firewalls. What database size to expect? Database sizes vary depending on many factors: Regular user processing. Automation by applications. Storage of documents, pictures, etc. Use of Track Changes feature. etc. We can only try to predict, with big tolerance for error, the regular user processing. As a rule of thumb, each user generates approximately between 0.25 and 1.00 GB of data per year."

Many types of resources can be protected with keys: Subsystems Entity types Individual records Individual attributes Visuals, like forms, panels, etc. etc. To access a protected resource, the user must possess the required access key. User Groups Permissions are managed through User Groups. A user group gives access to a list of access keys. The members of the user group receive access to all keys in the group. Note There is no way to revoke access to specific access key for specific user. When a user is added to a security group, they receive all keys. Design carefully your security framework, so that revoking is not required. Action permissions Access keys give general permission to access a resource. This gives the permission to retrieve the resource from the database. However, this might not give permission for specific operations (actions) over the resource. Each resource type has a pre-defined set of actions, which might require permissions. When a security group is assigned an access key, the assignment also specifies which actions are allowed. Basic actions, which most data resource types define are: Update Delete Note Read is included in the access key."
