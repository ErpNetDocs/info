Includes support for calendar appointments, reminders, questionnaires, etc. Can be used to represent appointments, scheduled meetings, visits, contracts and just about any generic document. Opportunity - sales opportunity, with expected revenue and probability. It does not have detail line items. Offer - sales offer (quote), with line items. It allows optional selection of some of the items, which the customer has accepted. Sales Order - sales order from the customer. The main sales document. All documents before it are optional. The sales order initiates the logistics and financial processes, related to the sale. Invoice Order - an order to issue an invoice. This is an internal document, which is used to track the invoices, which we have to issue. Invoice - legal and financial document, finalizing the sales process. Note The above diagram shows only the CRM part of the whole process. The full process involves many different modules of the ERP system. Modules There are many modules in the CRM subsystem. They are used to manage the different aspects of the CRM processes: Contacts and tasks - calendar appointments, party definitions, etc. Pre-sales - Opportunities management, quotation, etc. Sales - Sales Orders, customers, etc. Invoicing - Invoicing process management, invoices and BI. POS - Manage point-of-sale activities in physical stores. Marketing - Marketing campaigns, activities, distribution channels, etc. Distribution - field sales, sales person targets management, etc. Pricing - price lists management. Product Configuration - create products based on specs for job shops (made-to-order and engineer-to-order environments). Products - manage products master data - products and product measurements, codes, variants, channel, pictures, groups, etc."

However, todays workloads are rarely just internal users, using the default UI clients. Service apps, Internet users and third-party UI apps take their toll. Their load levels are hard to predict. Note Small business subscriptions are based on concurrent internal users only, and not on cores. They can incorporate service and Internet apps, but their load is prorated to internal users. Check your reseller for more information. Hardware capacity description Although \"core\" licensing is originally based on hardware specifications, nowadays it is sized through software and the exact hardware specs are just an approximation. Having said that, each core is allocated capacity, approximately equal to: 1 CPU core for SQL Server 32 GB RAM for SQL Server 1 CPU core for Application server 4 GB RAM for Application server (but not less than 8 GB per app server)"
