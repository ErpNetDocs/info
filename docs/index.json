Includes support for calendar appointments, reminders, questionnaires, etc. Can be used to represent appointments, scheduled meetings, visits, contracts and just about any generic document. Opportunity - sales opportunity, with expected revenue and probability. It does not have detail line items. Offer - sales offer (quote), with line items. It allows optional selection of some of the items, which the customer has accepted. Sales Order - sales order from the customer. The main sales document. All documents before it are optional. The sales order initiates the logistics and financial processes, related to the sale. Invoice Order - an order to issue an invoice. This is an internal document, which is used to track the invoices, which we have to issue. Invoice - legal and financial document, finalizing the sales process. Note The above diagram shows only the CRM part of the whole process. The full process involves many different modules of the ERP system. Modules There are many modules in the CRM subsystem. They are used to manage the different aspects of the CRM processes: Contacts and tasks - calendar appointments, party definitions, etc. Pre-sales - Opportunities management, quotation, etc. Sales - Sales Orders, customers, etc. Invoicing - Invoicing process management, invoices and BI. POS - Manage point-of-sale activities in physical stores. Marketing - Marketing campaigns, activities, distribution channels, etc. Distribution - field sales, sales person targets management, etc. Pricing - price lists management.

With its help, employees can easily create and estimate the value of new products and categories, responding to market fluctuations within a few days. It allows manufacturing companies to fully implement the requirements of their customers, receiving in advance details about the price and features of products with any degree of complexity. Shortening the time from offer to order With the Product Configurator, you can easily configure new product models according to customer requirements. This enables sales teams to quickly make complex offers multi-component products and execute orders with 100% accuracy. The convenient user interface of the Product Configurator allows you to create flexible models by inputting only the parameters of the device. Thus you can customize products according to customer needs. Once a client sends you the features of a desired product, it can immediately be incorporated into the production schedule so you can calculate the delivery date and estimated value and price. Improved communication between the Sales and the Manufacturing Department Creating products with the Product Configurator minimizes the risk of operational errors. It is closely tied with the production and financial modules of ERP.net and any change in price lists or in the information about the available production capacity is reflected in calculations. Thanks to this, your customers will always receive accurate information. Automatic creation of manufacturing technologies With the Product Configurator, you can extremely easily create new products based on predefined questionnaires or finished articles. Configuring product parameters is quick and easy, and you can also add various graphic schemes, statistics and history to products. Once the articles are configured according to customer requirements, the system automatically creates a unique specification and manufacturing technology. The result is a reduction in the physical work in production planning and ensuring the manufacturing process in creating new products. Moreover, calculations are performed automatically according to current price lists. If there is repetition of the article, the ERP system allows you to easily make partial amendments of specifications and technological recipes. The whole process customer order-offer-manufacturing-shipment of finished products is easily controlled all the time, and the interface provides information on implementation. Integration with Module Material Planning The tight integration of the Product Configurator with the Material Planning module enables users to receive information about possible delivery dates of raw materials within the promised turnaround time of each order, as well as signals for possible delays. You can track changes in manufacturing technologies directly from the module. The technology is established during product configuration and any changes in parameters are immediately taken into account. This avoids the manual recovery of hundreds of unique features."

The control covers both revenue and expenditure warehouse operations to ensure up to date information on stocks. The verification process by barcode readers is carried out after products have already been collected and moved to the checking place. An employee opens a special form in the system designed for implementation monitoring. The data in the form is filtered by order number or addressee. Then the product check with a barcode reader begins. Timely warning The module can find discrepancies between a scanned item and the documented information about it. It automatically triggers an audible and visual alarm. If there is an attempt to register an amount which is larger than the actual order, the system displays an error message accompanied by an audible signal. In case the registered amount is lower than the order, the corresponding line turns red so that it gets checked by an employee who can see if this is a mistake or the product is not available. After verification, the module automatically generates a warehouse receipt for the amount, which is a signal to check out the goods from the warehouse. Facilities at work To avoid the need to use a keyboard, there is an option for the printed orders to feature a barcode for the document number. An additional convenience is the option to print out a list of barcodes for different amounts that can be scanned when an order includes several identical items. For example, an employee first scans the barcode of “10x” from the list and then the product itself. The aim is to avoid repeated scanning of products which are the same."

Click to call Customer identification on incoming call Call notes Customer identification on incoming call allows one-click opening of the 360-degree dossier of the customer. Which PBX systems can be integrated with the call center functionality? Currently, only Asterix is supported natively as server-to-server functionality. Other systems, requiring client-only connections are left as third-party solutions. In the future, all real-time call-center functionality will be implemented as apps (internal or third-party). This will allow much greater scaling of the connectivity features. Which email servers are supported for the email integration? Exchange, IMAP, POP3. Note Currently, Exchange integration can also be used for Office 365. However, in 2021, Microsoft intends to disable Exchange functionality for Office 365 and this connection will no longer be usable for Office 365. Do you intend to build Office 365 connector for email integration? Yes, we do intend to build such functionality as add-on app. Timeframes for implementation are unknown."

    "keywords": "Hosting & Reliability Q&A Does the ERP.net service feature high availability? Yes. There are many components in an ERP instance - database, application servers, web servers, apps, reverse proxy, process manager, etc. Each component is hosted on a hardware, which is always having a stand-by backup hardware, ready to take over in a case of a hardware failure. All network components are also stacked for high availability. Each network component is cross-connected to each host. The point is, there is no single point of failure. Is the system monitored at all times? Yes. There is a dedicated team, monitoring all systems 24x7x365. In case of an issue, reaction time is usually in the 5-15 minutes range, day and night. What happens in case of a hardware problem? The most important part is the problem to be automatically detected by the watchdog systems. Once the problem is detected, an automatic failover occurs. The failover is usually within 30-60 seconds. Most of the time, the users might notice just a slight delay in their processing. What is the reaction time in case of an issue? First of all, most issues auto-resolve themselves, because each component has high-availability and the workload is automatically transferred to another node. However, should it reach to a human intervention, the reaction time usually is within 5-15 minutes, day and night, 24x7x365. Is the system monitored from outside? Yes. There are at least two different locations, usually in different countries or states, which has automatic watchdogs setup. Each alarm for non-availability is reviewed by human operators. What hardware is used for the service? There are a lot of moving parts in a proper ERP service. Reliability is the most important factor when choosing the correct hardware. Performance comes second, but is also of paramount importance. It is hard to describe all hardware, but here are some quick facts: Database servers: Top of the line, data center grade, specialized frequency optimized CPU. These usually cost around 10 times more per core than regular CPUs. 32 GB RAM per core. Optane SSD drives for caching and temp db. NVMe SSDs for databases. 2 x 100 Gbit network to stand-by server. 4 x 10 Gbit network connection to application servers. Application servers: Enterprise grade general-purpose CPU for application processing. 4 GB RAM per application core. SSDs for storage. 2 x 10 Gbit/s network connection Network components: Enterprise grade Cisco routers, switches and firewalls. What database size to expect? Database sizes vary depending on many factors: Regular user processing. Automation by applications. Storage of documents, pictures, etc. Use of Track Changes feature. etc. We can only try to predict, with big tolerance for error, the regular user processing. As a rule of thumb, each user generates approximately between 0.25 and 1.00 GB of data per year."
