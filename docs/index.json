Includes support for calendar appointments, reminders, questionnaires, etc. Can be used to represent appointments, scheduled meetings, visits, contracts and just about any generic document. Opportunity - sales opportunity, with expected revenue and probability. It does not have detail line items. Offer - sales offer (quote), with line items. It allows optional selection of some of the items, which the customer has accepted. Sales Order - sales order from the customer. The main sales document. All documents before it are optional. The sales order initiates the logistics and financial processes, related to the sale. Invoice Order - an order to issue an invoice. This is an internal document, which is used to track the invoices, which we have to issue. Invoice - legal and financial document, finalizing the sales process. Note The above diagram shows only the CRM part of the whole process. The full process involves many different modules of the ERP system. Modules There are many modules in the CRM subsystem. They are used to manage the different aspects of the CRM processes: Contacts and tasks - calendar appointments, party definitions, etc. Pre-sales - Opportunities management, quotation, etc. Sales - Sales Orders, customers, etc. Invoicing - Invoicing process management, invoices and BI. POS - Manage point-of-sale activities in physical stores. Marketing - Marketing campaigns, activities, distribution channels, etc. Distribution - field sales, sales person targets management, etc. Pricing - price lists management. Product Configuration - create products based on specs for job shops (made-to-order and engineer-to-order environments).

The standard BI evolves with each new version of the platform. The problem is that it might not have the custom view required by some custom tailored business processes. Custom Business Intelligence Custom BI utilizes some external BI tool, like Microsoft Power BI . Custom BI has access to the data through API and can be used to build custom cubes, KPIs, dashboards and more. The custom BI can be integrated directly in the system through web views, context filtered by the on-screen data.
