<h1 id="data-processing-agreement">Data Processing Agreement</h1>
<p>This Data Processing agreement (“DPA”) is adopted by the parties as an Appendix of the erp.net’s Platform Terms of Use. All the definitions used in the Platform’s Terms of Use are valid in this DPA, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>Hereinafter the Data Controller, or just Controller, is the Customer under the Platform’s Terms of Use. The Customer will be called a Controller even in cases where it’s not a Controller under the definition of GDPR of the personal data being processed.</p>
<p>And ERP.net Corporation Ltd, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively &quot;ERP.net&quot;) hereinafter will be referred to as: the “Data Processor”.</p>
<p><strong>HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p>
<h2 id="1subject-matter-of-this-data-processing-agreement">1.	Subject matter of this Data Processing Agreement</h2>
<p>1.1. This Data Processing Agreement applies to the processing of personal data subject to EU Data Protection Law in the scope of the agreement of between the parties for the provision of services relating to the Data Controller’s use of ERP.net’s Cloud Services, Support Services and Professional Servies on the erp.net platform as outlined in Section 3.1 of the Platform Terms Of Use (“Services”) (hereinafter to be referred to as: the “Service Agreement”)</p>
<p>1.2. The term EU Data Protection Law shall mean Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)</p>
<p>1.3.	Any capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Data Processing Agreement shall have the meaning given to them in the Service Agreement. Except as modified below, the terms of the Service Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Other terms used in this Data Processing Agreement that have meanings ascribed to them in the EU Data Protection law, including but not limited to “Processing”, “Personal Data”, “Data Controller” and “Processor,” shall carry the meanings set forth under EU Data Protection Law.</p>
<p>1.4.	Insofar as the Data Processor will be processing Personal Data subject to EU Data Protection Law on behalf of the Data Controller in the course of the performance of the Service Agreement with the Data Controller, the terms of this Data Processing Agreement shall apply. In the event of a conflict between any provisions of the Service Agreement and the provisions of this Data Processing Agreement, the provisions of this Data Processing Agreement shall govern and control. An overview of the categories of Personal Data, the categories of Data Subjects, and the nature and purposes for which the Personal Data are being processed is provided in Appendix 2.</p>
<h2 id="2the-data-controller-and-the-data-processor">2.	The Data Controller and the Data Processor</h2>
<p>2.1. Subject to the provisions of the Service Agreement, to the extent that the Data Processor’s data processing activities are not adequately described in the Service Agreement, the Data Controller will determine the scope, purposes, and manner by which the Personal Data may be accessed or processed by the Data Processor. The Data Processor will process the Personal Data only as set forth in Data Controller’s written instructions and no Personal Data will be processed unless explicitly instructed by the Controller.</p>
<p>2.2. The Data Processor will only process the Personal Data on documented instructions of the Data Controller to the extent that this is required for the provision of the Services. Should the Data Processor reasonably believe that a specific processing activity beyond the scope of the Data Controller’s instructions is required to comply with a legal obligation to which the Data Processor is subject, the Data Processor shall inform the Data Controller of that legal obligation and seek explicit authorization from the Data Controller before undertaking such processing. The Data Processor shall never process the Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Data Controller’s documented instructions. The Data Processor shall immediately notify the Data Controller if, in its opinion, any instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection provisions. Such notification will not constitute a general obligation on the part of the Data Processor to monitor or interpret the laws applicable to the Data Controller, and such notification will not constitute legal advice to the Data Controller.</p>
<p>2.3.	The Parties have entered into a Service Agreement in order to benefit from the capabilities of the Processor in securing and processing the Personal Data for the purposes set out in Annex 2. The Data Processor shall be allowed to exercise its own discretion in the selection and use of such means as it considers necessary to pursue those purposes, provided that all such discretion is compatible with the requirements of this Data Processing Agreement, in particular the Data Controller’s written instructions.</p>
<p>2.4.	The Data Controller warrants that it has all necessary rights to provide the Personal Data to the Data Processor for the Processing to be performed in relation to the Services, and that one or more lawful bases set forth in EU Data Protection Law support the lawfulness of the Processing. To the extent required by EU Data Protection Law, the Data Controller is responsible for ensuring that all necessary privacy notices are provided to data subjects, and unless another legal basis set forth in EU Data Protection Law supports the lawfulness of the processing, that any necessary data subject consents to the Processing are obtained, and for ensuring that a record of such consents is maintained. Should such a consent be revoked by a data subject, the Data Controller is responsible for communicating the fact of such revocation to the Data Processor, and the Data Processor remains responsible for implementing Data Controller’s instruction with respect to the processing of that Personal Data.</p>
<h2 id="3confidentiality">3.	Confidentiality</h2>
<p>3.1. Without prejudice to any existing contractual arrangements between the Parties, the Data Processor shall treat all Personal Data as confidential and it shall inform all its employees, agents and/
or approved sub-processors engaged in processing the Personal Data of the confidential nature of the Personal Data. The Data Processor shall ensure that all such persons or parties have signed an appropriate confidentiality agreement, are otherwise bound to a duty of confidentiality, or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
3.2. Except where Applicable Data Protection Law provides otherwise, Processor shall keep a record of any Disclosure that is made for a minimum period of six months, including, but not limited to:
(a)	the name and address of the Third Party to which Personal Data were disclosed;
(b)	Personal Data which were disclosed;
(c)	date and time on which Personal Data were disclosed; and
(d)	the purpose of the disclosure.
3.3. Processor shall provide its employees access to Personal Data only to the extent necessary to perform the Processing. Processor shall ensure that any employee it authorises to have access to Personal Data Processed on behalf of Processor respects and maintains the confidentiality and security of the Personal Data.</p>
<h2 id="4security">4.	Security</h2>
<p>4.1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the Data Controller and Data Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security of the processing of Personal Data appropriate to the risk. These measures shall include, at a minimum, the security measures agreed upon by the Parties in Annex 3.</p>
<p>4.2.	Both the Data Controller and the Data Processor shall maintain written security policies that are fully implemented and applicable to the processing of Personal Data. At a minimum, such policies should include assignment of internal responsibility for information security management, devoting adequate personnel resources to information security, carrying out verification checks on permanent staff who will have access to the Personal Data, conducting appropriate background checks, requiring employees, vendors and others with access to Personal Data to enter into written confidentiality agreements, and conducting training to make employees and others with access to the Personal Data aware of information security risks presented by the Processing.</p>
<p>4.3.	Processor shall make available to Data Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Annex. Such information will in any case include necessary information on (i) the security measures as described in Appendix 3 of this Annex, (ii) any Sub-Processor (including copies of the agreements with those Sub-Processors), (iii) Data Security Breaches, (iv) return or deletion of Personal Data, (v) international data transfers and the safeguards taken to address transfer restrictions and (vi) measures in place to allow Data Controller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p>4.4.	The Data Processor’s adherence to either an approved code of conduct or to an approved certification mechanism recognized under EU Data Protection Law may be used as an element by which the Data Processor may demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in Article 4.1, provided that the requirements contained in Annex 3 are also addressed by such code of conduct or certification mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="5improvements-to-security">5.	Improvements to Security</h2>
<p>5.1. The Parties acknowledge that security requirements are constantly changing and that effective security requires frequent evaluation and regular improvements of outdated security measures. The Data Processor will therefore evaluate the measures as implemented in accordance with Article 4 on an on-going basis in order to maintain compliance with the requirements set out in Article 4. The Parties will negotiate in good faith the cost, if any, to implement material changes required by specific updated security requirements set forth in EU Data Protection Law or by data protection authorities of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>5.2. Where an amendment to the Service Agreement is necessary in order to execute a Data Controller instruction to the Data Processor to improve security measures as may be required by changes in EU Data Protection Law from time to time, the Parties shall negotiate an amendment to the Service Agreement in good faith.</p>
<h2 id="6data-transfers">6.	Data Transfers</h2>
<p>6.1.  Upon the conclusion of this Data Processing Agreement, the Data Controller grants its authorisation to the Data Processor to transfer Personal Data to the sub-processors listed in the Data Processor’s List of Sub-processors. The Data Processor shall be obliged to provide the List of Sub-processors to the Data Controller upon a written request by the latter. The Data Proccessor shall promptly notify the Data Controller of any planned permanent or temporary transfers of Personal Data to a third country, including a country outside of the European Economic Area without an adequate level of protection. If the relevant sub-processor is not on the List of Sub-processors, the Data Processor shall only perform such a transfer after obtaining authorisation from the Data Controller, which may be refused at its own discretion. The Data Processor will only undertake such a transfer if it is strictly necessary for the performance of the Service, as outlined in Section 8.2.1. of the Terms of Use (Protection of Customer Data) and under the conditions therein.</p>
<p>6.2.	Where a transfer of Personal data, subject to this Agreement, to a third country is necessary, the Data Processor shall be deemed to provide appropriate safeguards to protect the Personal data, including by virtue of making available Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent as a transfer mechanism.</p>
<p>6.3.	To the extent that the Data Controller or the Data Processor are relying on a specific statutory mechanism to normalize international data transfers and that mechanism is subsequently modified, revoked, or held in a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the Data Controller and the Data Processor agree to cooperate in good faith to promptly suspend the transfer or to pursue a suitable alternate mechanism that can lawfully support the transfer.</p>
<h2 id="7information-obligations-and-incident-management">7.	Information Obligations and Incident Management</h2>
<p>7.1. When the Data Processor becomes aware of an incident that has a material impact on the Processing of the Personal Data that is the subject of the Services Agreement, it shall promptly notify the Data Controller about the incident, shall at all times cooperate with the Data Controller, and shall follow the Data Controller’s instructions with regard to such incidents, in order to enable the Data Controller to perform a thorough investigation into the incident, to formulate a correct response, and to take suitable further steps in respect of the incident.</p>
<p>7.2. The term “incident” used in Article 7.1 shall be understood to mean in any case:
•	a complaint or a request with respect to the exercise of a data subject’s rights under EU Data Protection Law;
•	an investigation into or seizure of the Personal Data by government officials, or a specific indication that such an investigation or seizure is imminent;
•	any unauthorized or accidental access, processing, deletion, loss or any form of unlawful processing of the Personal Data;
•	any breach of the security and/or confidentiality as set out in Articles 3 and 4 of this Data Processing Agreement leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, the Personal Data, or any indication of such breach having taken place or being about to take place;
•	where, in the opinion of the Data Processor, implementing an instruction received from the Data Controller would violate applicable laws to which the Data Controller or the Data Processor are subject.</p>
<p>7.3.	The Data Processor shall at all times have in place written procedures which enable it to promptly respond to the Data Controller about an incident. Where the incident is reasonably likely to require a data breach notification by the Data Controller under EU Data Protection Law, the Data Processor shall implement its written procedures in such a way that it is in a position to notify the Data Controller without undue delay after the Data Processor becomes aware of such an incident.</p>
<p>7.4.

</ul>
<p>Data Processor personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. Data Processor conducts reasonably appropriate backgrounds checks to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and statutory regulations. Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge receipt of, and compliance with, Data Processor’s confidentiality and privacy policies. They are provided with training and personnel handling Customer Data are required to complete additional requirements appropriate to their role.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Security</strong></p>
<p>Data Processor uses geographically distributed data centers and stores all production data in physically secure data centers. Data Processor Sub-processor’s production data centres employ measures to secure the access to data processing systems. They have an access system that controls access to the data center. This system permits only authorised personnel to have access to secure areas. The facilities are designed to withstand adverse weather and other reasonably predictable natural conditions, are secured by around-the-clock guards, CCTV monitoring, access screening and escort-controlled access, and are also supported by on-site back-up generators in the event of a power failure.</p>
<p>The data center electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and maintainable without impact to continuous 24/7 operations. In most cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source is provided for critical infrastructure components in the data center. Backup power is provided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) batteries or diesel generators which are capable to provide emergency electrical power supply or reliable power protection during utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions.</p>
<p>Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of failure and minimize the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Data Processor Sub-processor’s production equipment and facilities have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the process for and frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer’s or internal specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the data center equipment is scheduled through a standard change process according to documented procedures.</p>
<p><strong>System Access Control</strong></p>
<p>Data Processor servers use a Linux based implementation customized for the Services. Data Processor employs a review process to increase the security of the operating systems used to provide the Services and enhance the security products in production environments.</p>
<p>Data Processor has, and maintains, a security policy for the personnel. Data Processor infrastructure, development and support personnel are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of Data Processor’s security of the infrastructure, the review of the Services, and responding to security incidents.</p>
<p>Data Processor’s internal access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorized persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process customer data, including personal data. Data Processor aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorized persons to access data they are authorized to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during processing, use and after recording. Data Processor employs an access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to authorized personnel. The following may, among other controls, be applied depending upon the particular Services ordered: authentication via passwords and/or two-factor authentication, SSH keys, authorization processes, change management processes, logical access to the data centers is restricted and protected by firewall/VLAN and logging of access on several levels. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; and a need to know basis. The granting or modification of access rights must also be in accordance with Data Processor’s internal data access policies.</p>
<p><strong>Services Access Control</strong></p>
<p>Customer and End Users must authenticate themselves via an authentication system in order to use the Services. Each application checks credentials in order to allow the display of data to an authorized End User.</p>
<p>The following may, among other controls, be applied depending upon the particular Services ordered: authentication via passwords and/or two-factor authentication, SSH keys, authorization processes, change management processes, and logging of access on several levels. Depending upon the particular Services ordered the following controls may also apply: unique identifiers are attributed to the responsible individual, revoke access mechanisms on consecutive failed login attempts and lockout time periods, password expiry and reset mechanisms, password complexity requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Data Access Control</strong></p>
<p>Data Processor stores data in a multi-tenant environment, meaning that multiple customers’ deployments are stored on the same physical hardware. Data Processor uses logical isolation to segregate each Customer’s data and logically separates each Customer’s data from that of others. This provides the scale while rigorously preventing customers from accessing one another’s data.</p>
<p>Customer is given control over specific controls for sharing access to the data to End Users for specific purposes in accordance with the functionality of the Services. Customer may choose to make use of these controls. Data Processor makes available certain logging capability.</p>
<p>Direct access to customer data is restricted and in case such is required access rights are established and enforced only to properly authorized staff in addition to the access control rules set forth in the previous Sections.</p>
<p><strong>Transmission Control</strong></p>
<p>Data centers are typically connected via high-speed private links to provide secure and fast data transfer between data centers. This is designed to prevent data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during electronic transfer or transport or while being recorded onto data storage media or exchanged within the data center.</p>
<p>For data in transit, Data Processor uses industry standard transport protocols such as SSL and TLS between Customer devices and Data Processor’s Services and data centers, and within data centers themselves. Except as otherwise specified for the Services (including within the Order, the applicable Agreement or the User documentation of the Services), transmissions of data outside the Service environment are encrypted. Some functionalities of the Services may enable the Customer to choose unencrypted communications in their use of the Service. Customer is solely responsible for the results of its decision to use such unencrypted communications or transmissions.</p>
<p><strong>Input Control</strong></p>
<p>The Personal Data source is under the control of the Customer, and Personal Data integration into the system, is managed by secured file transfer, via web services or entered into the application from the Customer. As set forth in Section Transmission Control above, some functionalities of the Services permit Customers to use unencrypted file transfer protocols. In such cases, Customer is solely responsible for its decision to use such unencrypted field transfer protocols.</p>
<p>The Services will not introduce any viruses to Customer Data; however, the Services do not scan for viruses that could be included in attachments or other Personal Data uploaded into the Services by Customer. Any such uploaded attachments will not be executed in the Services and therefore will not damage or compromise the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Network Control</strong></p>
<p>Data Processor blocks unauthorized traffic to and within the data centers using a variety of technologies such as firewalls, NATs, partitioned Local Area Networks and physical separation of back-end servers from public-facing interfaces.</p>
<p>Data Processor employs multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Data Processor considers potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external facing systems.</p>
<p>Data Processor and authorized personnel will monitor the Services for unauthorised intrusions using network-based intrusion detection mechanisms. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Data Processor’s intrusion detection involves tightly controlling the network communication attack surface through preventative measures such as firewalls, employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points and employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Response</strong></p>
<p>Data Processor maintains security incident management policies and procedures and monitors a variety of communication channels for security incidents. Data Processor personnel will react promptly to known incidents and will promptly notify Customer in the event Data Processor becomes aware of an actual or reasonably suspected unauthorised disclosure of Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>System Logs</strong></p>
<p>Data Processor ensures that processing systems used to store Customer Data log information to their respective system log facility. Log entries are maintained in case there is suspicion of inappropriate access and an analysis is required. Logging is kept securely to prevent tampering.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability and Backup</strong></p>
<p>For the Services, Data Processor ensures that backups are taken on a regular basis. Backups are secured using a combination of technical and physical controls.</p>
<p>Data Processor ensures that the systems where Customer Data is stored have a disaster recovery facility and are governed under disaster recovery plan. In the event production facilities are to be rendered unavailable, Data Processor will execute recovery plans to restore operation in timely manner. Data Processor has designed and regularly plans and tests its disaster recovery plans.</p>
<p><strong>Data destruction</strong></p>
<p>When customers delete data or leave the Service, Data Processor ensures the data is deleted as per the terms in the applicable Agreement. For certain disks Data Processor follows strict rigorous standards that call for overwriting storage resources before reuse, as well as physically disposing of decommissioned hardware. Data Processor Sub-processor’s production data centres employs strict procedures for reuse, redeployment, data destruction and decommission of disks and hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Subprocessor Security</strong></p>
<p>Before onboarding Sub-processors, Data Processor conducts an audit of the security and privacy practices of Sub-processors to ensure Sub-processors provide a level of security and privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope of the services they are engaged to provide. The Sub-processor is required to enter into appropriate security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms.</p>
<p><strong>System Changes and Enhancements</strong></p>
<p>Data Processor may enhance and implement changes in the Services during the term of the Agreement. Security controls, procedures, policies and features may change or be added. Data Processor will provide security controls that deliver a level of security protection that is not materially lower than that provided as of the Effective Date.</p>
