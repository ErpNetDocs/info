<h1 id="definitions">Definitions</h1>
<p>You will find the definitions of the used terms and phrases in their exact contextual meaning below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Internal use licenses</strong><br>
These are licenses, which the partner can use to manage their own internal processes in the company.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Support incidents allowance/discount</strong><br>
This covers any fees which might occur when raising tickets for internal processes and/or clients.
The allowance is specified per year and covers support costs up to the provided amount.
After this, the discount is applied to further support fees.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tech/Sales specialist</strong><br>
A person, who has covered a minimal course/training for the problem area.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Certified Tech/Sales specialist or Developer</strong><br>
A person, who has successfully passed certification exam (provided by ERP.net) for the problem area.
Certified specialists have to be dedicated to the role and cannot share another role (for the purposes of eligibility for the partner program).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Active client project</strong><br>
An active client subscription, where the client has specified the partner as the primary support partner.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New projects / year</strong><br>
Indicates how many new projects are started through a year of partnership.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New users / year</strong><br>
Actually, it would be more correct to call it “<strong>Increase in user base per year</strong>”.
Indicates the increase in total user base for a year of partnership.
If there are customers, which decrease the user base or cancel their subscriptions totally, this counts towards decrease in user base.
It should be offset with increased sales to achieve the specified total increase.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use ERP.net for internal processes</strong><br>
Obligates the partner to manage their internal processes through ERP.net.
This serves double purpose – both educational for internal staff and demonstrative to potential prospects.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Partner fee / billed annually</strong><br>
The partner fee, although specified per month is billed once per year as monthly amount * 12.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Internal chats</strong><br>
These are chats with representatives of ERP.net for non-support issues.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Customer support commission</strong><br>
The support commission is paid by ERP.net to the partner.
The requirement is the end customer to specify them as primary support partner.
The support commission covers expenses of the partner for non-paid support, such as bug reporting.
The partner has the obligation to report such bugs to ERP.net without requiring payment from the end customer. The support commission can be employed only in cases when ERP.net is invoicing directly to the end customer.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Test / Demo / Model instances</strong><br>
These are ERP.net instances, up to one of each type, in addition to the internal use instance.
They can be provided upon request of the partner.
They include up to 5 users and up to 10 GB in size.
Test instance is usually based on the currently developed new version of ERP.net.
Demo is on latest stable release.
Model instance, when it exists, is used for new clients of the partner.
Using the model instance, the partner can setup specific workflows for their new customers.
The cost for these instances, under the constraints specified here, are included in the partner package.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Marketing opportunity</strong><br>
ERP.net lists all partners on its website.
When a new potential client asks for an implementation partner, ERP.net might send the opportunity to the partner.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Customer retention</strong><br>
Indicates customer retention for both users and number of clients.
The partner should keep at least the specified percentage of users/clients at the year, compared to the beginning of the partnership year.
Abandoning clients/users count towards decreasing the customer retention.
Only clients, for which there is an effective Customer support commission or Resell agreement are counted towards the retention calculation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Universal app in the ERP app store</strong><br>
A universal app is an application whose IP is owned by the partner. The app should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be usable by more than one specific client.</li>
<li>Listed on the ERP.net app store.</li>
<li>Be available for purchase by any ERP.net client.
E.g., it should not be limited to the clients of the partner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reseller agreement</strong><br>
This is separate agreement between ERP.net and the partner, regarding the right for resell of ERP.net products and services.
The partner retains the specified commission from the revenue of the end customer.
Resellers bear the same responsibility for non-paid customer support as in the case of “Customer support commission”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
