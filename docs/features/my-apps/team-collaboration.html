<h2 id="social-groups-in-">Social Groups in ERP.net</h2>
<p><strong>Social Groups</strong> provide a set of team collaboration tools in ERP.net, implementing the <strong>social ERP</strong> concept into the platform.
The module is suitable and adaptive to all companies regardless of size, sector, or structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106669250/234564887-b7b05300-5307-4d4e-af00-6ba4d392527f.png" alt="Team-collaboration-and-social-groups-screenshot-upscaled"></p>
<p>Groups enable you to virtually represent your company's <strong>actual teams and their work</strong> within ERP.net's environment.
Social Groups help your organization <strong>grow</strong>, <strong>connect</strong>, and <strong>streamline</strong> work and information flows in three major aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a common digital workspace for people to connect, share, and accomplish.</li>
<li>Retain the focus on the role of the specific team to avoid unwanted distractions while working.</li>
<li>Combine all the necessary information and activities, streamed in a single, well-known place.</li>
</ol>
<p>Groups help in defining teams in order to easily <strong>match the job to the right people</strong>, organized by department, project, or designation.
This helps managers <strong>assess</strong> the numerous chunks of work, <strong>structure</strong> them into assignments, and <strong>distribute</strong> them throughout the relevant teams.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Adding a new team member into a group instantly shares all the group's information with them.
This enables your company to <strong>simplify and accelerate the onboarding</strong> of new team members and help them become well-adept of their role.</p>
</div>
<p>Social Groups include various integrated features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatter</strong> - instant communication with replies and reactions similar to common social media networks</li>
<li><strong>Shared Calendar</strong> - for sharing events, such as organized meetings, calls, time off, and others</li>
<li><strong>To Do</strong> - reminders about pending work with due dates, reminder times, notes, status, and others</li>
<li><strong>Group Files</strong> - a place for sharing files of common interest to the selected group members</li>
<li><strong>Group Members</strong> - options for listing and administration of the selected group members</li>

<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
