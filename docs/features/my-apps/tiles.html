<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Information nowadays is everywhere we turn and look.
And thankfully so, since <strong>deep and detailed information is absolutely imperative</strong> for achieving a great performance with our numerous assignments.
Hence, it is one of the <strong>highest-in-value resources</strong> we have at our disposal.</p>
<p>Growing information can quite overwhelm us, though.
So many companies, customers, partners, and teams around us means we are constantly operating with more and more data.</p>
<p>Storing this information in a <strong>unified, understandable way</strong> in a <strong>single, secure place</strong> is one thing.
Finding <strong>strictly what we need</strong> - <strong>now</strong>, <strong>fast</strong> - is another.</p>
<p>And the more fast-paced our business environment is, the more the importance of <strong>quick and suitable access to data</strong> increases.
Having to navigate back and forth to the same types of data time and again, especially under pressure, can be challenging.</p>
<p>And this is a challenge that <strong>ERP.net</strong> enables you to instantly tackle with its built-in application <strong>Tiles</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="your-data-on-focus">Your Data on Focus</h2>
<p>Rapidly occurring tasks, speaking with customers and partners, and responding to questions and inquiries all share something in common - the necessity to <strong>find what you are looking for fast</strong> and <strong>understand it with confidence</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ERP.net's Tiles</strong> application enables your teams to <strong>preview and access information</strong> about interesting groups of records <strong>neatly organized in tiles</strong>.
Each tile shows a <strong>caption</strong> and the <strong>number of records that will be presented</strong> when you select it.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/k1kolev/info/assets/106669250/c56a2764-c65c-40c3-b9dc-514e363c0128" alt="Tiles-erp-net-image-2023-08-25-transformed"></p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>You and your team can create tiles to <strong>bring up specific groups of records</strong> that you find more <strong>valuable or suitable for the task at hand</strong>.
This easy solution helps your team always keep important information one touch away.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="let--do-the-navigation-for-you">Let ERP.net do the navigation for you</h2>
<p><strong>ERP.net's Tiles</strong> app lifts repetitive labor off your shoulders, letting you <strong>focus more on achieving</strong> and <strong>less on seeking</strong>.
Enhancing navigation, <strong>tiles</strong> also <strong>act as shortcuts</strong> to their <strong>related groups of records</strong>.</p>
<p>When set without any filters, <strong>tiles</strong> can bring up <strong>tables of records</strong> that you find <strong>more important</strong> or <strong>frequently visit</strong>.
Your system <strong>does all the navigation for you</strong> in a split second.</p>
<h2 id="leave-the-heavy-lifting-to-tiles">Leave the heavy lifting to Tiles</h2>
<p><strong>Tiles</strong> are able to do more than just lead to places of interest - they can <strong>display specific records</strong> that are intended to <strong>grab your attention</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tiles</strong> also <strong>store the combination</strong> of all the <strong>filters</strong> you set up when creating them.
This makes them capable of <strong>predefined filtering</strong>, bringing up <strong>only the records matching your requirements</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/k1kolev/info/assets/106669250/79444394-ad2b-4267-ac90-f6e68cccd084" alt="Tiles-erp-net-navigator-filters-applied-2023-08-25-transformed"></p>
<p>This empowers your business to <strong>avoid distractions</strong>, <strong>save time</strong>, and <strong>speed up progress towards shared goals</strong> by staying focused on what is <strong>currently important</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="a-powerful-ally-in-your-everyday-business">A powerful ally in your everyday business</h2>
<p><strong>ERP.net's Tiles</strong> app natively embraces <strong>user-friendliness</strong> for <strong>ease of use</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tiles</strong> can be <strong>shown at various locations</strong> in the platform, wherever your business deems them fit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show them on your dashboard</strong> to make them visible at first glance</li>
<li><strong>Review them in the dedicated Tiles panel</strong> of ERP.net's My Apps collection</li>
<li><strong>Display them within any panel, record, or next to any table of records (navigator)</strong> to implement them in context</li>
<li><strong>Display several tile panels in the same location</strong>, each showing a different group of tiles aligning with your needs</li>
</ul>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>You can give each tile a <strong>suitable name</strong> to let your teams <strong>know in advance what to expect</strong> when <strong>viewing and selecting them</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="get-exactly-what-you-need-at-your-fingertips">Get exactly what you need at your fingertips</h3>
<p>The variety of situations we find ourselves in our highly dynamic business landscape demands us to <strong>stay flexible and adaptive</strong>.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, you and your team members find yourselves <strong>constantly using the same table of records</strong>.
But with each of your tasks, you are interested in a <strong>distinct subset of those records</strong> differing from the rest <strong>in some properties</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, a lot of your day may be spent <strong>reviewing the available quantities</strong> of your products.
However, <strong>each specific inquiry</strong> or <strong>order</strong> of a customer has you looking at the <strong>availability of distinct items</strong> in your <strong>store</strong> or <strong>warehouse</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tiles</strong> app helps your business <strong>accelerate information retrieval</strong> in such situations.
<strong>ERP.net</strong> provides you the opportunity to create <strong>as many tiles for the same table of records as desired</strong>, varying in <strong>filter criteria</strong>.
All of them will <strong>lead to the same table</strong> but will <strong>show different contents within</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="versatile-by-nature-and-adaptive-by-business">Versatile by nature and adaptive by business</h3>
<p>Just as with all the apps in <strong>ERP.net</strong>, versatility is a native trait of the <strong>Tiles</strong> app.</p>
<p><strong>Tiles adapt to the location</strong> they are visualized in when <strong>using them as a widget</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>widget Tiles panel</strong> in your <strong>ERP.net platform</strong> is dependent on the context of the specific location where it is displayed.
The system <strong>automatically determines the tiles relevant to this location</strong> and makes them <strong>available for display</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/k1kolev/info/assets/106669250/91d48fd3-fa52-48b3-9d6d-f54dc76dfcb2" alt="Tiles-erp-net-navigator-widget-in-context-2023-08-25-transformed"></p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>You can select <strong>various tiles having different filter combination</strong> in the same location with a single tap.
This makes the app capable of <strong>switching between different subsets of records</strong> directly within the <strong>context of your work and your actions</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="collaboration-is-the-new-norm-in-business">Collaboration is the new norm in business</h2>
<p>To <strong>empower your team collaboration</strong> and <strong>firmly establish consistent work manners</strong>, <strong>tiles</strong> are <strong>role-oriented</strong>.
Each tile is saved in relation to a <strong>specific role</strong>.</p>
<p>Your company can enjoy the boost in collaboration in several directions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Teamwork</strong>: Everyone using a given role is guaranteed to see and use exactly the same collection of tiles on their dashboard and in their personal app</li>
<li><strong>Focus and Guidance</strong>: The role your users select automatically brings them a collection of tiles with it, indicating the important or frequently visited tables of records</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: People sharing the same role will immediately come across any changes applied to tiles, helping everyone stay up to date with the latest organization of your work</li>
</ul>
