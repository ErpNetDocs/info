<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Oftentimes in today's business environment, we take on many roles and responsibilities.
Respectively, we face all kinds of tasks and carry out various actions to accomplish them.
Many experts, managers, and creators are adept to work in multiple areas, professional fields, and industries.</p>
<p>The comprehensiveness and scope of our work requires our attention and <strong>eye for detail</strong> at so many places.
This can have us <strong>going back and forth</strong>, <strong>navigating through</strong> various modules, apps, and panels of our business software, <strong>searching for</strong> information and continuously <strong>checking for</strong> something.</p>
<p>What if, instead of dashing rapidly through here and there, we had <strong>a single location that greets us</strong> every time we access our business management platform?</p>
<p>A spot that contains everything we need in a simple, yet effective form, allowing us to review the things that <strong>matter the most</strong>, in a quick look.
Something that we can <strong>personalize</strong> to suit perfectly to every role we and our team members decide to take for the projects and assignments we face ahead.</p>
<p>This way we'll always know where to start from.
The <strong>ERP.net platform</strong> has a definite answer to help you with this.</p>
<h2 id="dashboard-in-">Dashboard in ERP.net</h2>
<p><strong>The Dashboard in ERP.net</strong> is the one place in the system that <strong>brings to your attention all the things necessary</strong> to start your day and go through it winning at your business.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dashboard</strong> enables you neatly organize and put together the apps and tools that you use on a daily basis, providing a quick glance at what captures your interest the most.</p>
<p>Your <strong>Dashboard</strong> is <strong>completely customizable</strong> and can help you <strong>build a digital home</strong> hosting everything you regularly use for the role you have and the work you do at your company:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calendar</strong> - bringing <strong>an all-around view</strong> of your engagements like <strong>meetings</strong>, <strong>appointments</strong>, and others in multiple types of views, such as <strong>a day, week, and month view</strong>, complemented by tiles summarizing your events for the current day and week.</li>
<li><strong><a href="todo.html">To Do Tasks</a></strong> - providing <strong>a list of reminders</strong> for all those quick and simple actions you have to take, arranged by their state of completion.</li>
<li><strong><a href="team-collaboration.html">Social Groups</a></strong> - combining intuitive means for team collaboration like <strong>chats</strong>, <strong>team calendars</strong>, <strong>group to dos</strong>, <strong>shared file management</strong>, and others.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline</strong> - showing <strong>a line of events and documents</strong> someway <strong>involving you and your currently selected company</strong> you work in, such as <strong>scheduled meetings</strong>, <strong>sent offers</strong>, <strong>closed sales</strong>, <strong>issued invoices</strong>, and others.</li>
<li><strong><a href="tiles.html">Tiles</a></strong> - previewing <strong>sets of records</strong> like <strong>the events</strong> for the current day and week, <strong>the customers</strong> of a given company, <strong>sales made</strong> for the current year, <strong>products</strong> of a particular group, <strong>individual prices</strong> to a customer, or anything other, that can be <strong>loaded in a single tap</strong> while <strong>automatically applying the desired pre-saved filter combination</strong> for a specific purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Favorites</strong> - listing <strong>specific items or objects that capture your interest</strong> for any reason like <strong>a particular document chain</strong> (<strong>an offer</strong> leading to <strong>a closed sale</strong> leading <strong>to an issued invoice</strong>) or <strong>a customer</strong>, <strong>supplier</strong>, <strong>dealer</strong>, <strong>vehicle</strong> - anything and anyone you work with.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../ui-ux-features/web-view.html">Web View panels</a></strong> - enabling you to <strong>integrate a view of a website</strong>, giving you an opportunity to <strong>browse and use a website</strong> directly from your <strong>Dashboard</strong>, such as <strong>a web app</strong>, <strong>a supplier order platform</strong>, or even <strong>any panel from your own ERP.net instance</strong> visualized within the <strong>Dashboard</strong> of <strong>that same instance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various other kinds of features, such as <strong>accounting and sales analyses</strong> for receiving quick insights, <strong>your notifications</strong> for taking a peek at what happened recently, <strong>showing multiple instances of your tiles and web view panels</strong> to extend your reach to your resources, and others add up to the <strong>endless functionality of your Dashboard</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-and-application-of-the-dashboard-in-">Purpose and Application of the Dashboard in ERP.net</h2>
<p>The <strong>all-around Dashboard</strong> in <strong>ERP.net</strong> is intended to <strong>summarize your most interesting aspects</strong> throughout your work.
This enables the Dashboard to <strong>display the apps that help you pursue your commitments and undertakings on a single, neatly arranged screen</strong>.</p>
<p>To do so, the <strong>Dashboard</strong> combines <strong>a suite of tools and features</strong> to <strong>visualize all the data you constantly look at, access, and use</strong> during your day.
The <strong>Dashboard</strong> is <strong>your one-stop solution</strong> to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>review interesting snapshots from your calendar, timeline, and task apps</strong> - your personal appointments, the meetings you participate in, your to dos</li>
<li><strong>access any number of records present somewhere in the system via the tiles you set up</strong> - for example, the details of your contacts, the leads you put efforts into for converting them to paying customers, the current availabilities of items in your stores, the received and still-to-receive payments from your customers</li>
<li><strong>get to a specific item in a single tap</strong> - a particular supplier of yours, a marketing campaign that is going on, or a sales target your company has set</li>
<li><strong>receive quick insights</strong> - events that happened today or this week, showing what new has been going on in your company concerning you</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="app-integration-capabilities-of-your-dashboard">App Integration Capabilities of Your Dashboard</h2>
<p>Thanks to <strong>the native integration capabilities of ERP.net</strong>, each app you see in your <strong>Dashboard</strong> is just a window (a panel) <strong>visualizing in real time the actual app</strong> that is running in its designated place in the system.</p>
<p>This means <strong>each time you act in some way through any app displayed on your Dashboard</strong>, <strong>your actions take effect in the app itself, automatically and immediately</strong>.</p>
<p>These examples can help <strong>illustrate this concept in practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating a new meeting</strong> through <strong>the Calendar widget</strong> shown on your <strong>Dashboard</strong> does so <strong>directly in your Calendar app</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Completing a to do</strong> from your <strong>Dashboard</strong> marks it as accomplished <strong>in your To Do app</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Chatting</strong> with your team or <strong>sharing files</strong> with them via your <strong>Groups widget</strong> displayed on your <strong>Dashboard</strong> happens <strong>in your Groups app</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This architecture of the <strong>ERP.net</strong> platform <strong>eliminates the necessity for synchronization and the possibility for unsaved progress or any delays</strong> - syncing simply becomes unnecessary when <strong>everything happens immediately where it is supposed to</strong>.</p>
