<h1 id="integrated-websites-in-">Integrated Websites in ERP.net</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The ERP.net platform supports a variety of <strong>integrated websites</strong>.
These websites are brought up and run around the central core of the ERP.net system.</p>
<p>Their designation is to offer expanded functionality to company teams, management, partners, customers, local and state authorities, and others.</p>
<p>Integrated websites are web applications that serve to support a range of business operations, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>API integrations</li>
<li>Service portals</li>
<li>Customer service</li>
<li>Cross-platform synchronizations</li>
<li>Specific worker-style apps, like WMS Worker</li>
<li>System administration and other technical operations<br>
etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="integrated-website-licensing">Integrated Website Licensing</h2>
<p>Integrated Websites are available after purchasing a license for each of them.
Website licenses are counted toward the website instances, taking into consideration only <strong>the number of websites</strong> which have been started.</p>
<p>Each license provides <strong>a slot</strong> for an integrated website and <strong>does not limit</strong> the type of website that can be used with it.</p>
<p>To learn more about the licensing of integrated websites and how it works, head to our dedicated topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="../../information/licensing/integrated-websites-licensing.html">Integrated Website Licensing</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="website-license-usage-example">Website License Usage Example</h3>
<p>For example, if you choose to use the Client Center, the Domain API, and the Revenue Service Portal, you will need <strong>3 website licenses</strong>.</p>
<p>After that, you can even swap these websites on the go.</p>
<p>Suppose that after some time, you decide that you no longer intend to use the Domain API, or at least temporarily won't be using it.<br>
In addition, you assessed Table API would be beneficial to your business.</p>
<p>You can remove the Domain API from your website list within the ERP.net platform.
Then, you can use the freed-up slot to put another website - in this case, the Table API.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Most website types can be started more than once - for example, the Client Center (for more info - see below).</p>
</div>
<h2 id="types-of-integrated-websites-in-">Types of Integrated Websites in ERP.net</h2>
<h3 id="1-web-client">1. Web Client</h3>
<p>The web client of <strong>ERP.net</strong> is one of the primary ways to connect to your <strong>ERP.net</strong> instance and its data.
It is one of the most widely used integrated websites of the platform.</p>
<p>You use the web client for a <strong>huge variety of actions</strong>.
Frequent uses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily use of your <strong>ERP.net</strong> platform - <strong><a href="../my-apps/index.html">Personal Productivity</a></strong>, <strong><a href="../my-apps/team-collaboration.html">Team Collaboration</a></strong>, <strong><a href="../crm/index.html">CRM</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="../index.html">ERP</a></strong> modules and systems.</li>
<li>Navigate your platform and review the information stored inside - through menus, tabular navigators, record forms, tiles, and other tools.</li>
<li>Enter and edit data for your business - like products, customers, partners and dealers, logistics, production, financials, projects, business applications, and all day to day operations.</li>
<li>Set up the layout (interface) of your platform, roles, permissions, and access levels for users, as well as make changes to your settings.</li>
<li>Define your document types and chains, custom business logic (workflows, rules, stored and calculated attributes), configurations, managed entities, currencies and exchange courses, and many other parameters.</li>
<li>Run a variety of UI functions, monitor the audit logs and change history, view current sessions, track exec stats, check table sizes and record counts, and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>The web client can contribute to practically everyone in your company - employees, managers, CEO, and others.</p>
<p>One instance of the web client is included (without additional charges) in all subscription plans for all editions of ERP.net.</p>
<h3 id="2-domain-api">2. Domain API</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/dev/domain-api/index.html">Domain API</a></strong> in ERP.net serves a connector between the ERP.net platform's core and external apps.</p>
<p>External apps are special apps targeting the very individual needs of a given industry sector or even a specific company using ERP.net.
As such, they are created with a distinct purpose.
That's why oftentimes, external apps are custom-built for this company or at least this industry sector to ensure proper execution and completion of specific tasks and activities.</p>
<p>The Domain API offers a large range of business benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides read-write access to the client's ERP.net database.</li>
<li>Supports external apps generating large amounts of data.</li>
<li>Supports a modern, secure authentication mechanism verified through the ERP.net platform.</li>
<li>Ensures compliance and accordance with the business logic with every operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these characteristics empower your business with a secure and reliable integration solution for custom external apps.</p>
<h3 id="3-table-api">3. Table API</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/dev/topics/table-api/index.html">Table API</a></strong> in ERP.net is used for streaming data from the database to external applications.</p>
<p>It is intended mainly for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business intelligence (BI) operations with an external BI app.</li>
<li>Backup/Data dump apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Table API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows read-only access to the database, perfect for performing analytics.</li>
<li>Provides quicker query processing (compared to Domain API) as the simplified read-only access does not require data to pass through complex conversions.</li>
<li>Allows processing of huge volumes of data, as the streaming protocols allow constant low memory usage.</li>
<li>Speeds up data flow as it does not require checking up with the whole business logic for operations.</li>
<li>Supports contemporary authentication types for uncompromised security.</li>
</ul>
<p>The speed, secure access, and straightforward data flow mechanisms of the Table API make it the perfect choice for preparing reports and performing analytical operations with preferred external BI systems and apps.</p>
<h3 id="4-b2b-portal-client-center">4. B2B Portal (Client Center)</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="../crm/client-center.html">Client Center</a></strong> of ERP.net is a portal for business-to-business (B2B) operations.
It is offered as a <strong>built-in</strong>, <strong>integrated solution</strong> for your business running in tandem with your ERP.net platform.</p>
<p><strong>ERP.net's B2B portal</strong> helps your company achieve top-tier client service by offering your business clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>chat</strong> with widely spread social media-like mechanics (with replies, reactions, and mentions) between your business clients and your company teams for instant communication.</li>
<li>A tabular navigator in which they can <strong>review their orders</strong> - listing both completed and currently processed orders.</li>
<li>A way to <strong>cancel orders</strong> that have not yet entered the processing phase.</li>
<li>A section for <strong>placing new orders</strong> by them, with controls for turning on and off this function.</li>
<li>A view of their <strong>unpaid orders and invoices</strong> with information for their due dates, status, remaining amounts, etc.</li>
<li>A tabular navigator to <strong>view and download their invoices</strong>, with controls for adjusting what data is visible to clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Client Center</strong> can be used with a license for an integrated website.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Each instance of the Client Center can set up for a single <strong><a href="../general/multi-company.html">business entity of yours</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This means <strong>one integrated website license</strong> can be used to set up a client center for <strong>one company of yours</strong>.</p>
<p>If your business consists of multiple companies and you plan on setting up a Client Center for more than one of them, you will need a number of website licenses equal to the number of owned companies that the Client Centers is set up for.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="5-wms-worker">5. WMS Worker</h3>
<p>ERP.net's <strong><a href="../logistics/wms-worker.html">WMS Worker</a></strong> is an app specially designed to guide warehouse workers through their daily tasks and responsibilities.</p>

<p>The mobile and web app is intended as a quick and easy way of performing routine operations done in small or simplified storage spaces.</p>
<p>Simplified storage spaces can be found practically anywhere - workshops, retail shops, and similar, storage rooms, etc.</p>

<p>The Inventory Control mobile app uses one integrated website license.</p>
<h3 id="7-revenue-service-portal">7. Revenue Service Portal</h3>
<p>ERP.net features an integrated <strong>Revenue Service Portal</strong> website used to automate and streamline preparing documentation and submitting legally required data to local, governmental, and other state authorities.</p>

This includes reports like:</p>

<p>In addition, the Revenue Service Portal of ERP.net allows state authorities personnel to access the reports required from your business through a secure web app with strict access control.</p>

<h3 id="8-microsoft-sync">8. Microsoft Sync</h3>
<p>The Microsoft Sync website is an integration solution connecting your ERP.net platform with your Microsoft 365 products.</p>
<p>It is designed to ensure proper synchronization of activities and other data between your apps and systems.</p>
<p>For example, calendar events like personal appointments and meetings are regularly synchronized between ERP.net's Calendar and your Outlook Calendar.
Changes made to an event in any of the two systems will apply to the other one as well after each sync.</p>
<p>Microsoft Sync takes one integrated website license to function.</p>
