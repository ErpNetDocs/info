<h2 id="omnichannel-overview">Omnichannel Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Omnichannel sales approach</strong> is a <strong>business model</strong> used by companies to provide a <strong>more attractive and convenient customer experience</strong> by <strong>complete integration</strong> of sales processes and data and enabling <strong>seamless switching over</strong> various sales channels for your customers.</p>
<p>Nowadays the presence of <strong>omnichannel support</strong> plays a huge role in a business's performance on the market.
Oftentimes, it is the primary reason behind leaving customers happy and receiving positive customer reviews, leading to <strong>recurring sales</strong> and <strong>bringing in new customers</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks to its cloud-native structure and natural integration capabilities, <strong>ERP.net platform</strong> comes with readily available fully integrated <strong>omnichannel sales support</strong> to automate the processes for order creation and preparation, inventory management, collecting payments, receiving customer feedback, and many others.</p>
<h2 id="how-multichannel-and-omnichannel-business-models-differ">How Multichannel and Omnichannel business models differ</h2>
<p><strong>Multichannel sales approach</strong> is a business strategy where <strong>multiple communicational channels</strong> are used for making sales and customer service and support.
Such approach gives customers the opportunity to use more than one channel (more than one way) to learn more about the products and services supplied by a given business, <strong>and ultimately, purchase them</strong>.
Customers can use various channels, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physically visiting the store</li>
<li>Booking or buying on the phone</li>
<li>Online shopping on desktop or mobile devices</li>
<li>Customer support via email, phone, website, social networks, mobile applications, or chat</li>
</ul>
<p>Derived from <strong>multichannel strategy</strong> and complemented by <strong><a href="unified-communications.html">Unified Communications</a></strong>, <strong>omnichannel sales</strong> is an evolutionary model that builds on top of it by <strong>completely unifying</strong> all possible sales channels and <strong>sharing the full set</strong> of data across them.
This allows a <strong>seamless integration</strong> of all the data encompassing the <strong>customer's interaction</strong> with a business and the products and services it offers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The integrated <strong>Omnichannel sales support</strong> into <strong>ERP.net platform</strong> allows your customers to <strong>move from one sales channel to another</strong> as many times as they like, without requiring them to provide the same information twice - be it spoken or digitally.
This way customers get a feeling for a <strong>consistent and progressive journey</strong> that continually <strong>adds actual value</strong> in response to their time and efforts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sales channel unification</strong> of ERP.net platform results in <strong>integrating all key data</strong> about any given customer and <strong>sharing it</strong> between sales agents, representatives, back-office staff, and managers.
Your staff gets access to a rich set of vital customer information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions raised and communication that took place across available channels</li>
<li>Past and current inquiries and orders made by the customer</li>
<li>Sales made to the specific customer</li>
<li>Price lists and discounts that apply for the customer</li>
<li>Bonus programs, coupons, and other benefits that attract customers and help pulling of new sales</li>
<li>Payments log and unpaid dues</li>
<li>Feedback and customer satisfaction data</li>
</ul>
<p>And while <strong>multichannel</strong> provides a solid foundation for a customer to utilize more than one way to find and buy products and services or seek support, <strong>omnichannel sales</strong> empower businesses to <strong>keep full track</strong> of <strong>all interactions and held communication</strong> with the customer, even when <strong>switching the interaction channel</strong>, from the very beginning of the customer journey, along with journals storing calls, inquiries, orders and sales records.</p>
