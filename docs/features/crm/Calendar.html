<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Calendars are well-known and widespread tools used for event management purposes.
<strong>ERP.net Calendar</strong> is a valuable tool that empowers <strong>coordinated planning, execution, and tracking</strong> of personal and team assignments, as well as holding meetings related to <strong>decision-making, project management, and other activities</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="user-friendly-interface">User-Friendly Interface</h2>
<p>ERP.net Calendar's visual design incorporates a <strong>user-friendly interface</strong> that helps you quickly and easily <strong>navigate, view, and manage your business's appointments</strong> throughout the full set of events.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/k1kolev/info/assets/106669250/63ca0293-14e4-4b60-bbdf-e51323ded612" alt="calendar-and-tasks-transformed"></p>
<p>You can see <strong>all appointments</strong> in one place for a more general view of your company's engagements and commitments.
Alternatively, you can easily adjust <strong>filters</strong> based on <strong>various criteria</strong> for the appointments in your Calendar.</p>
<p>Using <strong>filtering</strong> you can select the <strong>filters</strong> you need and assign the <strong>desired values</strong> to them.
You can also set various <strong>combinations</strong> comprised from as many filters as desired.</p>
<p>This way the Calendar of ERP.net will show you <strong>only the appointments that match your filtering</strong>, no matter the complexity of combinations you wish to set for your filtering.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-legal-entities-in-your--calendar">Multiple legal entities in your ERP.net Calendar</h2>
<p>ERP.net Calendar also grants you opportunities for <strong>centralized event and human workload management</strong> when your business has <strong>more than one legal entity</strong> registered and operates these entities <strong>separately from a legal perspective</strong>.</p>
<p>The Calendar of ERP.net <strong>stores, manages, and shares</strong> <strong>real-time event information</strong> with all of your enterprises and parties within a common business structure or business franchise.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-you">What This Means for You</h2>
<p>You can <strong>create, edit, visualize, and work</strong> on common appointments, even when your arrangements concern <strong>participants taking roles in separate legal entities</strong> that are part of holdings and vast corporate business structures spanning <strong>multiple geographical locations and international markets</strong>.
This also applies to assigning tasks and meetings to people working in <strong>different departments and legal entities</strong> in your business structure.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>ERP.net Calendar shares event information within the <strong>selected enterprise entity</strong>, as well as with <strong>all enterprises</strong> owned by your business.
This feature strongly facilitates <strong>time and resource planning</strong>, providing <strong>precise and timely scheduling</strong> of each team's tasks.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="calendar-views-and-navigation">Calendar Views And Navigation</h2>
<p>The six Calendar views allow for more appropriate representation of the appointments according to the specific period of the schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day View - visualizes appointments throughout the <strong>selected day</strong></li>
<li>Work Week View - visualizes appointments throughout the <strong>selected work week</strong> (Monday to Friday for Europe and UK)</li>
<li>Week View - visualizes appointments throughout the <strong>selected 7-day week</strong></li>
<li>Month View - visualizes appointments throughout the <strong>selected month</strong></li>
<li>Timeline View - visualizes appointments on a <strong>timeline</strong> with days iterating on a horizontal axis</li>
<li>Gantt View - visualizes appointments as a <strong>Gantt chart</strong>, which is a useful feature for project management and task completion tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Back</strong> and <strong>Forward</strong> buttons in the <strong>Navigation</strong> tab of the ribbon provide convenient one-click switching between <strong>adjacent time periods</strong> in the currently set <strong>Calendar view</strong>.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Go to Today</strong> button in the ribbon to go to <strong>the present day</strong> independently on the view that you are currently using.</p>
<h2 id="calendar-appointments-and-types">Calendar Appointments and Types</h2>
<p>When you create a new appointment in ERP.net Calendar, you can choose between of the <strong>three system types of appointment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Meeting</li>
<li>Task</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>These types are system-based, and as such, their number and types are predefined.</p>
</div>
<p>We understand that every company, party, and person have their own <strong>custom necessities and requirements</strong>.</p>
<p>For this reason, your ERP.net Calendar provides you with the ability to create <strong>a diversity of document types</strong> for your appointments to meet all of your needs and make sure you are getting the best of your event management efforts.</p>
<p>You can configure <strong>new document types</strong> for appointments that best suit the various arrangements for your business.
Some examples for new documents you can configure include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sick Leave</li>
<li>Personal Engagement</li>
<li>Licenses And Client Subscriptions</li>
<li>Paid / Unpaid Leave</li>
<li>Meeting</li>
<li>Subscription Cancellation</li>
<li>Proposition</li>
<li>Potential Client Inquiry</li>
<li>Task</li>
<li>Demonstration</li>
<li>Message</li>
<li>Project Charter</li>
<li>Publication</li>
<li>Advertising Activity</li>
<li>Status Report</li>
</ul>
<p>and as many others as desired.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The document types can be configured by you or your ERP.net vendor.
If you have any difficulties with configuring new documents or any other settings, please contact your ERP.net vendor for help.</p>
</div>
<p>All appointments store information about the appointment's <strong>owner</strong>, <strong>the responsible party</strong>, as well as <strong>all participants</strong>.
Each participant is expected to take part with their own <strong>specific load</strong> in the meeting.
Thus, the load for each participant can be assigned as a percentage in the range <strong>0 - 100 %</strong>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>ERP.net Calendar is compatible with Microsoft Windows calendar, Microsoft Teams calendar, and Outlook calendar.
Appointments created or edited in ERP.net Calendar can be set to be automatically exported to external applications, notifying all concerned parties.</p>
</div>
<p>By bringing the individual schedules and integrating them into the platform, ERP.net Calendar facilitates <strong>organizing, tracking, and carrying out</strong> personal and group events for managers, employees, customers, partners, and all other stakeholders concerned no matter the size, location, or structure of the business.</p>
