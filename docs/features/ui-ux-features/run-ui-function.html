<h1 id="run-ui-function">Run UI Function</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Managing documentation is a necessity for every person and business out there.
These days, regulations and customer expectations can make it tedious and time-consuming.</p>
<p>This becomes even more daunting when using software products with a more general purpose or when trying to utilize in combination multiple disparate software apps and platforms with their own specific purposes.</p>
<p>Many business activities require multiple documents to be created, filled, and connected in a sequence that makes sense when complete.
Furthermore, various actions are often necessary when working with documents.
The most obvious examples include copying and voiding, with many others following.</p>
<p>Such needs drive companies to look for contemporary and intelligent tools on the market that can take on as much of the administrative efforts as technically possible.</p>
<p>ERP.net platform provides a modern, specialized UI functionality that results in faster business operations.
The Run UI Function within the platform is designed to ease the process of making it through the next steps of the document chain you're working on.</p>
<p>Learn how the <strong>Run UI function</strong> can empower your business to tackle your documentation challenges like a winner.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-documents-in-a-split-second">Preparing documents in a split second</h2>
<p>Keeping your documentation management carried out in a single, comprehensive platform empowers your organization through feasible and efficient operation.</p>
<p>Utilizing an all-in-one solution in your everyday business can facilitate a significant portion of the processes related to document fulfillment.</p>
<p>The Run UI Function of ERP.net enables you to perform a wide variety of actions in a fast and interactive way.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/k1kolev/info/assets/106669250/a962862a-00f6-4410-8e3a-35d15158f295" alt="Run-UI-Function-erp-net-image-2023-08-24"></p>
<p>The range of actions is immense, with common examples like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the record of a person, company, product, invoice, campaign, activity, or any other document or object</li>
<li>Create a sales order or a business meeting from an offer in a single tap</li>
<li>Use a sales order to generate an invoice and a shipment order in a split-second</li>
<li>Void an invoice, payment order, transaction, shipment, or other documents which do not contain the necessary or correct data</li>
</ul>
<p>ERP.net's Run function ensures your company can enjoy significant benefits in terms of cost efficiency, correct information, and ease of use when going through the process of managing people, businesses, and their data.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-records-in-a-meaningful-complete-documentation">Connecting records in a meaningful, complete documentation</h2>
<p>The Run function of ERP.net does more than just help you create sequential documents.
The platform utilizes its extensive functionality to automatically connect documents created with the Run function to those which they originate from.</p>
<p>This enables your company to keep track of the full document set related to a person, business, activity, or state requirement.
Using Run when preparing documentation facilitates you in tracing what came from where and who, as well as what follows after it, later on when the need arises.</p>
<p>Embracing the Run UI Function can save you valuable time when you want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What opportunity led to an offer you are seeing</li>
<li>Which sales order does an invoice you are reviewing come from</li>
<li>Did an offer lead to a closed sale with a customer</li>
<li>How many and which transactions do complete a specific payment you made or received</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracing and tracking your documents is always a glance and a tap away in ERP.net.</p>
<h2 id="to-sum-up">To sum up</h2>
<p>A boost in productivity and efficiency, an error-free documentation process, automated going through predefined, well-known, and worked-out routes when fulfilling documents - these are only some of the great advantages ERP.net can bring to your use.</p>
<p>Adding to automation, having an <strong>interactive</strong>, <strong>visually understandable way</strong> of <strong>completing actions related to documents and objects</strong> leads to a more intuitive and pleasant experience for everyone in your company.</p>
