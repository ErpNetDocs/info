<h1 id="accounting-module">Accounting Module</h1>

<p>Module Accounting of ERP.net automates financial and accounting activities. It supports current bookings, closing of accounts, VAT reporting, cash, bank and currency operations, assessment of inventories and accounting for claims and liabilities.</p>
<p>Accounting information can be integrated and presented visually in other modules of the ERP system, and together with subsystem Finance financial and accounting management align more closely.</p>
<h2 id="integration">Integration</h2>
<p>Module Accounting is fully integrated with the main system and changes in other modules are automatically reflected in the accounting records. This eliminates double data entry, saving time and costs.</p>
<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>
<p>The module automates various processes, such as creating accounting entries and all document types, currency revaluation, calculation of depreciation of assets, revaluation of receivables from customers and payables to suppliers, and finalization of accounts.</p>
<p>With the module, economic transactions are accounted for under preset templates. Accounting templates are a mechanism to indicate the system how to account for primary documents. They also allow you to define common operations in order to facilitate and accelerate entering accounting information.</p>
<p>The creation of an accounting template requires setting a sequence of operations. In each operation, it is defined where to take a sum from and which account to put it in.</p>
<p>Accounting templates are a very important tool to achieve maximum automation of labor. After the initial setup by an accountant, they allow you to distribute the tasks for entering primary data between accountants and people performing business transactions.</p>
<p>The module also allows adding dimensions in one account, modeling dimensions and automatic accounting operations, and connecting dimensions with data from operational documents. In addition, you can use it to make references by dimensions and combine them.</p>
<h2 id="individual-chart-of-accounts">Individual chart of accounts</h2>
<p>Module Accounting allows the creation of an individual chart of accounts. It has a tree structure, which allows you to quickly and easily find an account or a group of accounts. You can define accounts and groups of accounts specific to your company, and to track them and keep accounts by various criteria.</p>
<h2 id="a-wide-range-of-statements-and-reports">A wide range of statements and reports</h2>
<p>The module provides a wide range of operational reports and financial statements and allows tracking of every accounting transaction. This facilitates the analysis of financial results and making management decisions.</p>
<h2 id="categorisation-of-revenue-and-expenditure">Categorisation of revenue and expenditure</h2>
<p>In module Accounting, you can enter and use the centers of revenue and expenditure to categorize income and expenses for accounting and management purposes by departments. Costs can be associated with revenue both manually and on a predetermined proportion, and information from reports can be visualized as a summary or in detail.</p>
<h2 id="simultaneous-tax-and-management-accounting">Simultaneous tax and management accounting</h2>
<p>Keeping tax and management accounts simultaneously is not an easy task because these two types of accounting need to answer different questions. They treats costs in different ways.</p>
<p>ERP.net allows you to use two charts of accounts simultaneously when entering primary accounting documents. Thus, as early as during the implementation of the system, you can set a management breakdown of costs and your own requirements for data visualization without interfering with accounting or tax requirements and regulations. This way the management will be able to get the necessary financial and accounting information without help from the accounting department.</p>
<h2 id="attaching-documents-to-accounting">Attaching documents to accounting</h2>
<p>ERP.net also allows you to attach invoices, payment orders and other primary documents to accounting. This saves time in searching for information in the archives and allows the management to make quick references on the details of accounting documents. This functionality is especially useful when performing accounting and internal company audits.</p>
