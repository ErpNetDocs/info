<h1 id="inventory-control">Inventory Control</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Many businesses operating small or uncomplicated storage spaces run <strong>simple daily operations</strong> within them.</p>
<p>Shops and retail stores, functioning as standalone stores or retail chains, are examples of places that perform <strong>basic storage manipulations</strong>.
These are usually <strong>replenishing stocks</strong>, <strong>counting available articles</strong>, and <strong>issuing sold products</strong> from the inventory.</p>
<p>Introduced in v.2024, <strong>ERP.net</strong> brings the <strong>Inventory Control</strong> mobile app - the solution enabling you and your staff to execute all these regular operations in your platform <strong>quickly and efficiently</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="running-a-more-productive-store">Running a more productive store</h2>
<p>The basic actions associated with the inventory of your store may be relatively simple, but these occupy <strong>a significant part of your employees' workday</strong>.</p>
<p>Retail stores and other simplified storage spaces go through several basic processes with their stock:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Receiving goods</strong> from suppliers or from other stores</li>
<li><strong>Issuing goods</strong> that are sold to customers or moved to other stores</li>
<li><strong>Counting stock</strong> in the storage area and on the shelves</li>
<li><strong>Transferring goods</strong> from one store to another</li>
<li><strong>Scrap stock</strong> that is damaged beyond sale, missing from your physical store, past its expiry date, or your store simply no longer needs it.</li>
</ul>
<p>These processes are an essential part of your shop or retail business.
But their repetitive nature can be tiring and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Cutting down on the time spent doing these leaves more time for other important and productive activities.
Implementing a solution that helps with menial operations is a way to achieve this.</p>
<p><strong>Inventory Control</strong> streamlines these processes and lets your team focus on <strong>serving your customers</strong> and <strong>consulting them on their needs</strong>.</p>
<p>As a result, your crew is able to direct their efforts at <strong>increasing the quality of your services</strong>.
The proper solution supporting your store is an investment that immediately starts to pay off, as keeping your customers happy and loyal drives more sales to your retail business.</p>
<h2 id="boost-your-performance-with-inventory-control">Boost your performance with Inventory Control</h2>
<p>Your business can benefit from utilizing the <strong>Inventory Control</strong> app in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reducing the time needed</strong> for executing your basic operations by guiding your staff step by step through them</li>
<li><strong>Minimizing the risk of errors</strong> by navigating employees through the job in a clear and straightforward way</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring a proper match</strong> between your store's physically available stock and your system records</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inventory Control</strong> operates within the <strong>Inventory Management System of ERP.net</strong> as part of the Advanced Logistics package.
This can facilitate your inventory management and automatically update your records for accounting and company purposes accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="speed-and-control">Speed and control</h2>
<p><strong>Inventory Control</strong> app is all about speed and simplicity of use.
The application fully supports barcode control and is designed especially for fast data entry via scanning.
To fully live to its purpose, it is built to run extensively on mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>By rapid scanning of series of barcodes</strong>, your store employees can accelerate the tedious process of manual data entry.
Even more, they can turn each step of line entry into <strong>a split-second, single-button click</strong> for whole stacks of products.</p>
<p><strong>Inventory Control</strong> allows scanning of not only product barcodes but also barcodes containing the quantity of the next product scanned.
Bringing up the built-in report of frequently used quantities allows you to view and print barcodes that represent these.</p>
<p>Use quantity barcodes to speed up your work tremendously - <strong>print them</strong> and <strong>stick them conveniently</strong> in your work area (on a wall, rack, or desk) where you process goods.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>When your store receives, sells, or counts 100 chocolates or 50 packs of coffee all at once, your staff needs to scan just 2 barcodes.</p>
<p>Just scan the appropriate quantity barcode (50 or 100) and the app will load and apply this quantity to your next scanned product.
Then, scan the product - and you are done.</p>
</div>
<p>This way your employees can carry out operations faster than ever and minimize the possibilities of manually made errors, all at the same time.
This applies to <strong>all operations supported</strong> by the app.</p>
<h2 id="designed-to-your-needs">Designed to your needs</h2>
<p>The <strong>Inventory Control</strong> application puts the focus on its users to bring maximum results for your business.</p>
<p>The application does not require any initial setup - it uses <strong>the current settings</strong> of your <strong>Inventory Management System</strong>.
Its native versatility as a web app allows it to be used <strong>with any modern browser</strong> on <strong>all operating systems and devices</strong>.</p>
<p>Finding a way to effectively <strong>record</strong> and <strong>keep track</strong> of your <strong>inventory movements</strong> and <strong>available products</strong> can play a huge part in <strong>shaping your bottom line</strong>.
And using the right application, originally integrated into your platform, will help you immensely in accomplishing all these tasks.</p>
<p>Coming with a <strong>sleek and responsive interface</strong>, Inventory Control offers <strong>a smooth and intuitive experience</strong> for your team.
Experience an app made to step up your abilities in the busy days of work - by your platform ERP.net.</p>
