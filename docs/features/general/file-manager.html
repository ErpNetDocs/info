<p><em>A modern way to organize, access, and use your business documents</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="documents-are-everywhere-and-thats-perfectly-normal">Documents are everywhere. And that’s perfectly normal.</h2>
<p>Every business works with documents.<br>
And not just a few.</p>
<p>Contracts, offers, invoices, specifications, spreadsheets, reports, images — they are part of every deal, every decision, and every operational activity, regardless of industry.</p>
<p>Interestingly, documents are rarely the “main topic.”<br>
They simply need to be there — when you look for them, when you open them, and when you work with them.</p>
<p>As a business grows, this expectation becomes even more important.<br>
More people, more processes, more information that needs to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>clearly organized</li>
<li>up to date</li>
<li>easy to access</li>
<li>logically connected to the work</li>
</ul>
<p>When documents are organized as part of the business context, work flows more naturally. Teams orient themselves faster, and the focus stays on tasks — not on searching.</p>
<p>This is exactly where <strong>File Management in ERP.net</strong> comes into play.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="one-place-for-all-files-and-documents">One place for all files and documents</h2>
<p>File Management in ERP.net brings documents to where work actually happens — inside the system itself.</p>
<p>Instead of existing separately, files are directly linked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>customers and suppliers</li>
<li>sales documents and invoices</li>
<li>projects and tasks</li>
<li>products, assets, and processes</li>
</ul>
<p>This means documents are always in the right place, in the right context, and at the right moment — without switching between systems or tools.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="file-management-in--1">File Management in ERP.net</h2>
<p>File Management in ERP.net is an integrated document management functionality built directly into the ERP platform.</p>
<p>It allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>store files securely</li>
<li>organize documents in a clear structure</li>
<li>link files to business objects</li>
<li>manage access and visibility</li>
<li>work with documents directly through the web interface</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this happens within a single system — without the need for additional applications or external repositories.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-new-way-to-manage-your-documentation">A new way to manage your documentation</h2>
<p>File Management in ERP.net introduces a familiar and intuitive logic, enriched with business context.</p>
<p>Documents are not just files — they belong to a:</p>
<ul>
<li>customer</li>
<li>project</li>
<li>product</li>
<li>process</li>
</ul>
<p>When you open a record in the system, you also see:</p>
<ul>
<li>the related files</li>
<li>the current versions</li>
<li>the complete document history</li>
</ul>
<p>Viewing and editing are done directly in the browser, making work easier and enabling teams to act quickly and confidently, without relying on local desktop applications.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="file-management-that-simply-works--and-does-it-elegantly">File Management that simply works — and does it elegantly</h2>
<p>File Management in ERP.net is not just a place to store files.</p>
<p>It is a way to make documents part of the business logic — naturally, clearly, and without effort from the user.</p>
<p>From the very first interaction, it becomes clear that everything has been carefully thought through.<br>
Not to impress at first glance, but to make everyday work easier.</p>
<p>File Management in ERP.net allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>store files securely and centrally</li>
<li>maintain a clear and logical document structure</li>
<li>link files directly to customers, projects, documents, and other business objects</li>
<li>control who sees and works with what</li>
<li>view and edit documents directly through the web interface</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this happens within ERP.net — without additional applications, without external repositories, and without having to “assemble” multiple tools.</p>
<p>The result is a sense of completeness.</p>
<p>Documents are exactly where you expect them to be.<br>
Working with them is smooth, consistent, and intuitive.</p>
<p>This is not just file management.<br>
It is a well-designed part of the overall business environment.</p>

<h2 id="how-businesses-use-file-management-in-">How businesses use File Management in ERP.net</h2>
<p>File Management in ERP.net adapts to the way different teams and industries work — from sales and field operations to quality control, engineering services, and management.</p>
<p><strong><a href="file-management-use-cases.html">See how File Management is used in real business scenarios</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-value-does-this-bring-to-the-business">What value does this bring to the business?</h2>
<p>File Management in ERP.net creates a sustainable and consistent way of working with information across the company.</p>
<p><strong>Clear structure</strong><br>
Documents and images are logically organized, including through a familiar and intuitive folder structure.</p>
<p><strong>Higher efficiency</strong><br>
Files are viewed and used directly through the web interface, without switching between applications.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability and traceability</strong><br>
Files are always linked to the correct business context, and the system automatically maintains these relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Better coordination</strong><br>
Different teams work with the same up-to-date information — in the office or on site.</p>
<p><strong>Intuitive user experience</strong><br>
The interface follows established best practices and allows fast adoption without training.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-integrated-file-management-matters">Why integrated file management matters</h2>
<p>At some point, every business reaches a clear but important conclusion:</p>
<p><strong>documents do not exist on their own.</strong></p>
<p>They are part of deals, projects, deliveries, inspections, analyses, and management decisions.</p>
<p>That is why it makes perfect sense for files to “live” where the business itself is managed.</p>
<p>File Management in ERP.net places documents in this context.</p>
<p>Files are not stored across separate servers, shared drives, or personal devices. Instead, they are logically connected within the system to customers, products, projects, deliveries, controls, and reports — directly within the business context.</p>
<p>This naturally changes the way people work:</p>
<ul>
<li>information is found where decisions are made</li>
<li>teams work with the same, up-to-date documents</li>
<li>relationships between files and business objects are maintained automatically</li>
<li>context is preserved over time, people, and organizational changes</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, documents stop being “attachments” and become an active part of managing processes, resources, and responsibilities.</p>
<p>This is what makes File Management in ERP.net such a natural extension of the entire system — because businesses are managed best when all information is in one place and speaks the same language.</p>
