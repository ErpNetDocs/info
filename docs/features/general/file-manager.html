<h1 id="file-manager-of-erpnet">File Manager of ERP.net</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Oftentimes, keeping files in an external storage (like local drives or cloud platforms) leads to searching through complex external directories to find a file you are looking for.
And this often leaves a gap between navigating through internal ERP entities and external file storage.</p>
<p><strong>File Management inside the ERP system</strong> is a <strong>feasible and productive way</strong> to <strong>close this gap</strong> and <strong>utilize the ERP system's full potential</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Some files</strong> are associated with <strong>a specific record</strong> in the ERP system.
They are an integral part of the record and make more sense if stored attached to it.</p>
<p>To meet these needs, your <strong>ERP.net system</strong> provides you with the universal functionality of <strong>attaching embedded or linked files</strong> to an <strong>internal record or other object</strong>, available throughout all subsystems.</p>
<p><strong>Other files</strong> are more <strong>generic documents for business use</strong>, such as documentation regarding training courses, internal or external regulations, company practices, handbooks, and so on.
These concern the organization as a whole and are used for <strong>general reference</strong> or as <strong>informational sources</strong>.
In this case, being able to upload them in an accessible storage, <strong>unattached</strong>, would be a more suitable solution.</p>
<p>To solve this, <strong>ERP.net</strong> now comes with the updated functionality <strong>File Management v2.0</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106669250/192732488-31f8ae5e-e010-4510-9703-e8d463070d9e.jpg" alt="file_manager"></p>
<p>Built upon the proven and trusted functionality of <strong>attaching documents to specific objects</strong>, <strong>File Manager of ERP.net</strong> now extends its abilities featuring a way to <strong>also store an unattached file</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>File Manager</strong> enables you to <strong>store and access</strong> your files and folders in an organized and straightforward way.
Its intuitive structure resembles the well-known <strong>Windows File Explorer structure</strong> users are used to.</p>
<p>The new functionality for organizing your work files and folders is accessible to all users of your ERP.net platform regardless of their workplace's physical location.</p>
<h2 id="file-manager-structure">File Manager Structure</h2>
<p><strong>File Management v2.0</strong> unlocks new opportunities by providing <strong>a uniform, centralized and shared structure</strong> for managing your business documentation in a cloud environment, integrated with the rest of your data within the ERP platform.</p>
<p><strong>ERP.net's File Manager</strong> uses a vertically-expandable <strong>hierarchical tree structure</strong> to arrange and represent your folders.</p>
<p>The <strong>File tree</strong> can be <strong>expanded or collapsed</strong> to <strong>list or hide</strong> subfolders for a more <strong>detailed</strong>, or conversely, a more <strong>compact</strong> layout.<br>
You can use the <strong>folder tree</strong> to easily <strong>view your folders</strong> and <strong>navigate throughout your directories structure</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Folder tree you can also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the definition (name, parent, and notes) of the selected folder.</li>
<li>Create a new folder</li>
<li>Change the name of the selected folder</li>
<li>Remove the selected folder from the folder tree and your storage</li>
<li>Refresh the contents of the folder tree</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Files</strong> window shows the files stored in the selected folder.
It also allows to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the selected file using an appropriate application</li>
<li>Save the selected file to your local storage or external storage</li>
<li>Delete the selected file(s)</li>
<li>Upload new file(s) to your ERP.net File Manager storage</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-manager-views">File Manager Views</h2>
<p>The layout options for visualizing your files are identical to the popular ones in Windows File Explorer.
<strong>Different layouts</strong> represent a <strong>different level of density and details</strong> for the files in the current folder.
There are currently <strong>eight available views</strong> for viewing your documents.
You can choose between different icon sizes, tiles, list, details, and other.</p>
<h2 id="file-manager-sections">File Manager Sections</h2>
<p>While in <strong>Details layout</strong>, you can assign <strong>sections</strong> to your files.</p>
<p>Sections will be shown in all other <strong>layouts</strong>.
Each section is represented by <strong>its name and a horizontal line</strong>, separating it from other sections.
This way the systems groups all of your files belonging to the same section.</p>
<p>By using sections, you can <strong>organize your files</strong> in a <strong>neat and convenient for you way</strong> to <strong>navigate visually</strong> throughout them even faster.</p>
<h2 id="uploading-files-to-your-file-manager-storage">Uploading Files to Your File Manager Storage</h2>
<p>You can store all types of files in your <strong>ERP.net File Manager Storage</strong>.
You can even <strong>select multiple files for upload</strong> and then upload them <strong>all at once</strong>.</p>
<p>Files can be uploaded and stored in your <strong>ERP.net storage</strong> using one of the available <strong>three storage methods</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embedded file</strong> - your file's <strong>full contents</strong> are uploaded to your <strong>ERP.net storage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Linked file</strong> - allows you to create <strong>a shortcut</strong> linked to the <strong>physical location of the file</strong> (a physical drive with shared access, or its shared partition or folder)</li>
<li><strong>Internet URL</strong> - create <strong>a shortcut</strong> linked to <strong>an object located on the Internet</strong> using a URL (for example, a shortcut to a website opened by your browser)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106669250/192736006-61e573e9-993f-4031-ade7-678d870cf62e.jpg" alt="file_manager_upload_options"></p>
<p>The <strong>Embedded file</strong> option is best suitable for <strong>small-sized file</strong> that are <strong>frequently used</strong> by your ERP.net instance's users.</p>
<p><strong>Linked file</strong> is a solution suitable for <strong>larger-sized files</strong> located on a <strong>shared resource</strong> accessible to your users, saving space on your ERP.net database.</p>
<p>And <strong>Internet URL</strong> is a great option for working with <strong>very large-sized files</strong> which are located <strong>on your external cloud storage</strong>, as well as accessing resources <strong>readily available on the Internet</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="opening-and-editing-your-files-with-your-file-manager">Opening and Editing Your Files with Your File Manager</h2>
<p>You can open and edit your files <strong>directly in ERP.net File Manager</strong> using a suitable application on your computer for each file type.</p>
<h2 id="file-manager-extensivity">File Manager Extensivity</h2>
<p>You can do so much more with <strong>File Manager</strong> without leaving your <strong>ERP.net environment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open and edit your files</strong> - do it directly via <strong>File Manager</strong>.
All changes to the file are <strong>saved immediately into the database</strong> where the file is located, as soon as you save the file.
Feel free to close your file afterwards or continue editing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Add quick notes to your files</strong> - these serve as a brief explanation or comments to the file.
The notes are added and shown in the <strong>Tiles</strong>, <strong>Contents</strong>, and <strong>Details</strong> layouts, next to your file's icon and name.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Filter your files</strong> - set one or more <strong>filters</strong> to exclude from showing files that may be irrelevant to your current activities.
Files can be filtered by various kinds of criteria, for example: file extension, type, symbols contained in the file name, date and time, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Search your file storage</strong> - use the <strong>main search bar</strong> to find the file you are looking for.
Use the <strong>full file name</strong> or just a <strong>part of the file name</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Set access restrictions for different users</strong> - limit access to your folders and files for various users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
