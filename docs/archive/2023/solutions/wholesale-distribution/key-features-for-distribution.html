<h2 id="omnichannel-sales-approach">Omnichannel Sales Approach</h2>
<p>ERP.net is built with a fully functional <strong><a href="../../../../features/crm/omnichannel-sales.html">Omnichannel Sales Support</a></strong> to support and manage the work of distribution companies that operate through various touchpoints and in <strong>multiple channels</strong>.
The system can <strong>capture orders</strong> from multiple channels, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>wholesale order requests</li>
<li>requests received on the phone</li>
<li>e-commerce</li>
<li>point of sale (POS)</li>
<li>field sales</li>
<li>electronic data interchange (EDI)</li>
</ul>
<p>By <strong>embedding omnichannel sales support</strong> in your business's inner workings, ERP.net enables <strong>vast integration and automation</strong> of the processes of customer communications and interactions, closing sales, receiving customer feedback, and much more.</p>
<p>Storing the complete communication and interaction history, customer records, and their orders and sales <strong>in a single place</strong> allows for the sales process to be conducted <strong>faster and more easily</strong>, <strong>regardless</strong> of where and when your customers and sales agents have previously interacted or currently do.</p>
<p>ERP.net <strong>provides each omnichannel sales agent</strong> with a <strong>real-time view</strong> of the <strong>inventory</strong>, <strong>order status</strong> for all orders, and the <strong>entire customer purchase history</strong> â€“ discounts, loyalty programs and payments, etc.
This way the sales staff can <strong>deliver to your customers</strong> a more accurate and timely service, increasing their <strong>satisfaction and loyalty</strong>.</p>
<p>Saving all sales data <strong>in one place</strong>, complemented by <strong>sophisticated business intelligence</strong>, arms your management with powerful <strong>analytics tools</strong>.
Managers can use these tools and results to <strong>analyze sales across all sales channels</strong>, allowing them to make <strong>smart, adequate, and consistent decisions</strong> for an adaptive and stable future of your business.</p>

You can create store orders for <strong>arranging the receipt and issuing</strong> of amounts of goods <strong>to and from your stores</strong> when supplies or sales are delivered, as well as <strong>create the related store transactions</strong> which <strong>apply the changes</strong> to stock quantities when the <strong>actual receipt or issuing</strong> of goods takes place.</p>

The module allows <strong>processing of purchase orders collectively</strong> in the same way to <strong>prepare receiving orders</strong> for receipt of goods based on them.</p>
<p>This situates the <strong>full operational cycle</strong> of processes for requesting, ordering, and receiving new material supplies <strong>in a single place</strong>, providing more stability, traceability, and ease of daily operation controls.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="../../../../features/financials/vat-reporting.html">VAT module</a></strong> automatically <strong>creates VAT log entries</strong> for purchases and sales, as well as <strong>VAT returns or VAT declarations</strong>.
The module <strong>periodically fetches data</strong> from ERP.net and uses it to automatically <strong>create all necessary official tax documents</strong>, arranging them in a <strong>ready-to-submit form</strong> that meets all state requirements.
With the help of the VAT module, you can accelerate the <strong>processes of preparing and submitting</strong> your <strong>tax documentation</strong> to your national revenue agency.</p>
