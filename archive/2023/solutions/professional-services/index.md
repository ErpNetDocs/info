Professional services companies have a separate set of requirements to manufacturing companies. However much of the core functionality of ERP systems, such as Finance, Sales and Purchasing, is common to all types of businesses. Customer relationship management (CRM) is also essential for a service company to run efficiently. CRM, which is often available as a module of ERP, includes contact management, sales activity tracking, marketing and customer service.
