# Registered User-Based Licensing

## Overview

**Registered User-Based Licensing** takes into account **the number of active users**, specified by your business, for using the **@@name platform**.  

Instances of **@@name Express** editions are licensed under the **Registered User-Based** licensing.  

## License terms

This licensing model permits a certain number of **active users**, described in the paid subscription plan. 
These users are able to log in and use **@@name platform** at the same time.  

Your business can create and store a practically unlimited number of **inactive user accounts** in your @@name platform.  

After reaching the **permitted number of active users** for your subscription, any **additional accounts** you create can only be set as **inactive**.  

> [!Note]  
> You can **easily switch** which users are **active** in your @@name platform's interface. 
> Changing an active user to inactive frees up a slot. 
> This slot can be used for another inactive user to be set as active.

## Additional information

### Per-user sessions

@@name editions that are licensed on a registered user basis allow all of your registered users to use the @@name platform simultaneously, as long as everyone is accessing the platform via a single session.  

A single session is brought up and active when a user is accessing @@name platform via either:  

* **@@name**'s desktop client 
* **@@name**'s web client through a single browser of choice

on a single device at a time.  

### Multi-session access

Accessing **@@name platform** by the same user via multiple desktop clients, browsers, operating systems, and devices is also possible. 
This is a multi-session access.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Multi-session access is available for your users on the condition that the total number of active sessions at a time does not exceed the total number of registered users.
