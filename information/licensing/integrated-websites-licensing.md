# Integrated Website Licensing

## Overview

Integrated Websites are web applications that support a variety of business operations like API integrations, B2B servicing, technical operations, and much more.  

These web apps extend the primary functionality of the @@name platform to the company's internal teams and external party relations like partners, customers, local and state authorities, and others.

## License Terms

Integrated Websites require a license to become operative. 
This licensing model permits a certain number of built-in websites to be set up and used.  

Integrated Website licenses take into account only the number of websites running integrated with @@name.  

Each license provides a free slot for a website **regardless of its type**.  

## Startable Websites

## Website License Usage Examples

### Starting Multiple Instances of The Same Website

You can start more than one website instance of most integrated websites.

One example could be a business consisting of three owned companies (or enterprise companies) that plans to set up the Client Center for two of them.  

Since the Client Center is associated with a single enterprise company, setting it up for two companies means starting two integrated websites.  

Each of the two companies will operate its Client Center, supported by one website.  

> [!Note]
> 
> It terms of licensing, starting multiple instances of the same type of integrated website is the same as starting single instances of different types of websites.
> 
> In all cases, each integrated website license **guarantees a slot** for starting a single website instance.  
>
> Only the number of websites are counted towards the purchased licenses.
> 
> Businesses are **free to choose the type** of websites they plan to use these slots for.  

### Swapping Integrated Websites

You can even swap your integrated websites on the go.  

Let's take a look at the following example:  

You choose to use the **Client Center**, the **Domain API**, and the **Revenue Service Portal**. 
Respectively, you will need 3 website licenses.  

Suppose that after some time, you no longer intend to use the Domain API, or you temporarily won't need it. 
In addition, you assessed the **Table API** would be more beneficial to your business.  

You can remove the Domain API from your website list within the ERP.net platform. 
Then, you can use the freed-up slot to put another website - in this case, the Table API.  

You can also disable the Table API and bring back the Domain API to reverse this action if desired.
