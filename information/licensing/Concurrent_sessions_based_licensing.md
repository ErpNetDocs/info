# Concurrent Sessions-Based Licensing

Instances of @@name which are registered and paid by the subscription plans **Small Business Basic** and **Small Business Advanced** are licensed under the **Concurrent Sessions-Based** licensing.
This type of license allows the client to run a **number of active sessions** at the same time.

## Single Concurrent Session Definition

A **single concurrent session** for an @@name instance is an active connection established between **a single desktop application**, or **web** or **mobile client**, on a single user's **device**, on one side, and the **servers** on which the @@name system's instance and the user database are present and operate, on the other.  

This session grants access to the system and the database for this user via this single application or web client on a desktop computer, laptop, or mobile device (a smartphone, tablet, or other).

### Example of a Singe Concurrent Session

An example of the former would be if you start **a single instance of your desktop application** OR **a single instance of your web client**, and then use it to connect to your @@name instance covered by your subscription plan.  

If no *specific conditions* apply, this would be deemed **a single active and concurrent session** between your user's application and the server.

## Multiple Concurrent Sessions Definition

**Multiple concurrent sessions** for an @@name instance occur when multiple active connections between **applications** and/or **web clients** are established to the **server** the @@name instance is present and is running on.  

These sessions allow our clients to execute, control, manage, and oversee their business processes from multiple locations, devices, and by multiple people and automated applications simultaneously.

### Example of Multiple Active and Concurrent Sessions

An example of multiple concurrent sessions would be if three of your staff members start their own single instances of their applications OR web clients, and then use each of these instances to connect to your @@name instance covered by your subscription plan.  

This would lead to *at least** **three** concurrent sessions for your @@name instance. 

> [!note]  
> A single device running multiple applications and/or web clients actively connected to @@name, as well as a single user connecting to @@name from multiple devices (regardless of using an application or web client), all at the same time, would result in **multiple concurrent sessions**.  

## Concurrent Sessions for Small Business Subscription Plans

The starting maximum allowed number of concurring sessions is defined as a base number for each of the **Small Business** subscription plans. Currently, the starting maximum number of allowed concurrent sessions is as follows:

* **Small Business Basic** - starts at a maximum of **three concurrent sessions** 
* **Small Business Advanced** - starts at a maximum number of **five concurrent sessions**. 

## Number of Users Allowed by a Single License

Additional concurrent sessions for your license may be purchased according to our price lists. The maximum number of concurrent sessions available for purchase is **35** for all **Small Business** subscription plans. 

If your @@name instance exceeds the this number of concurrent sessions and still does not cover your needs, we would be happy to offer a subscription plan that better matches your type of business and its needs.

## User Perspective and What This Means for You

For your business this means **you** and **your team** can have **as many active and unactive users and devices** configured to use your @@name instance as you like, even if the full number of users and devices exceeds the maximum allowed number of concurrent sessions in your personal subscription plan.  

As long as the **maximum number of concurrent sessions** that are running between your **applications and web clients**, on one hand, and the **servers**, one the other, **at the same time**, does not exceed the **maximum allowed number of concurrent sessions** for your plan, your stakeholders can use the platform fully functionally without any licensing obstacles.

> [!note]  
> The full number of devices that are configured to access or have previously accessed the system, as well as the full number of users that are granted rights for accessing your @@name instance are not limited by any manner regarding your license.
> Only sessions which are active and run simultaneously are treated as concurrent.

We will **not charge you** for the number of devices or user accounts you have set up for using @@name platform.

### Specific Cases and Conditions

There are specific cases in which a single application actively connected to @@name may result in creating more than one concurrent sessions.  

**External applications**, implemented by our official partners and running parallel with other external applications or parallel with the core system of @@name, are one example of applications that can create **multiple concurrent sessions**.

> [!note]  
> If a single application is trying to combine the work and processes of multiple other applications or internal users, this application will use the according number of concurrent sessions to function in a sustainable and proper manner.
