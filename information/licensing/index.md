# Licensing

The licensing section provides detailed information about ERP.net's licensing policy.

Depending on the selected subscription plan, ERP.net is licensed by one of the two types of licensing:

* **Concurrent sessions-based licensing** - allows a number of sessions going on at the same time which are paid with the current subscription
* **Core-based licensing** - grants a number of *cores* which are paid with the current subscription

More information about each type of license can be found by visiting the dedicated pages using the navigation panel on the left.
