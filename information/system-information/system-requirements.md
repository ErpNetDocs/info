# System requirements

@@name is a pure cloud solution.
You do not need to do anything for the hosting of the servers, databases, etc.

However, accessing an @@name instance from a client device has some system requirements.

## @@winclient System Requirements

The @@winclient is the primary tool for work-heavy users accessing an @@name instance.

@@winclient has some capabilities, related to its nature of being a native app:

* It allows local processing of huge data sets, provided there is enough RAM
* There are integrations with Windows for file management, working with office documents, etc.

### Minimal system requirements

* Windows 10 1809+
* 2 GB RAM
* 1 GB disk space
* Internet access

### Recommended system specs

* Windows 10/11 (latest stable release)
* 16 GB RAM
* 2 GB disk space
* Internet access

## Web apps

Web applications, (like Client Center) have no specific system requirements.
They run on all modern browsers and require negligible amounts of local RAM.
