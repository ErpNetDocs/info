# Financials FAQ

## General Ledger

### Are Cost Centers supported?

Yes.

Cost Centers are fully supported.

However, in the recent years, we prefer using another system for cost breakdown - account structure, based on custom attributes.
The reason is that this gives better flexibility for easily and properly reflecting real-world operations in the Financials subsystem.
