# CRM FAQ

## Unified Communications

### What call center functionalities are available?

* Click to call
* Customer identification on incoming call
* Call notes

Customer identification on incoming call allows one-click opening of the 360-degree dossier of the customer.

### Which PBX systems can be integrated with the call center functionality?

Currently, only Asterix is supported natively as server-to-server functionality.

Other systems, requiring client-only connections are left as third-party solutions.

In the future, all real-time call-center functionality will be implemented as apps (internal or third-party).
This will allow much greater scaling of the connectivity features.

### Which email servers are supported for the email integration?

Exchange, IMAP, POP3.

> [!note]
> Currently, Exchange integration can also be used for Office 365.
> However, in 2021, Microsoft intends to disable Exchange functionality for Office 365 and this connection will no longer be usable for Office 365.

### Do you intend to build Office 365 connector for email integration?

Yes, we do intend to build such functionality as add-on app.

Timeframes for implementation are unknown.
