# Try Out @@name Platform

## Introduction

You can try @@name Platform for free in its entirety, and here you will learn how.  

@@name Platform is **cloud-native**, which means it is offered as **software as a service (SaaS)**. 
This makes the system **accessible anytime from anywhere** via our **desktop client**, as well as **on the web** via any **contemporary compatible browser**.  

@@name is fully functional on virtually any **desktop, laptop, and mobile device** meeting the requirements.  

## Accessing @@name Platform

@@name Platform is accessed through the so-called **ERP instances**.  

When you subscribe for any @@name plan, you get an @@name instance. 
An **[ERP.net instance](https://docs.erp.net/tech/concepts/erp-instances.html)** is a tenant in the hosting environment. 
You use your @@name instance to connect to the database you wish to access.  

> [!NOTE]  
> 
> Every @@name instance has a **unique name**. 
> The instance can be accessed by **entering its URL address** in the **desktop client** or any **contemporary browser**.  
> 
> The **URL format** for accessing an instance is **https://<<instance_name>>.my.erp.net**, where <<instance_name>> is replaced by the instance's **unique name**.  

As an already registered and subscribed user of @@name Platform, this is most often your business's unified database used for everyday activities (also called the **productive database**).
