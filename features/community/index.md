# Community Management

Community Management is the base for the so-called "Social ERP".

Integration of customers, fans, partners, suppliers and generally all persons having relation with our company is crucial for achieving success in today's highly competitive economy.

Community Management is a new discipline in this area, channeling all communication and allowing a 360-degree view of not only the customers but the whole community.

Introduction of new and impromptu models of communication, like the [Chatter](chatter.md), brings everybody close and increases productivity.

@@name has focused on the inclusion of Community Management within the single central business information system.
New features will regularly be added to the Community Management subsystem.
