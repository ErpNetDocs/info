# Variable (Dynamic) Measurement Ratios

## Overview

Some industries trade products the quantity of which **may vary to some degree** for each individual piece of the product that is bought, processed, and sold. 
The **quantity deviations** from the nominal quantity may be caused by **various reasons**. 
Natural biological processes (for example, weight loss of dried foods), manufacturing specifics or inaccuracies (arranging pieces of the product in packages of larger units), or other processes and characteristics that are immutable by anyone.  

Such products are traded by utilizing **variable measurement ratios**. 
And @@name has got a detailed and specialized solution for them.  

## Examples

Many products are bought and **accounted for in one unit of measurement** (e.g., "lbs." or "kgs"), processed (for example, dosed or arranged in packages), and later sold and **accounted for in other unit of measure** (e.g., "pcs." or "packs"). 
Other products experience changes in weight through time.  

The following examples may provide **more clarity** on dynamic measurement ratios: 

A company buys potatoes in bulk from farms, **accounting for them in lbs. or kgs**. 
The packaging department then doses the potatoes in net bags, each of which has the same nominal weight. 
The company then proceeds to sell the net bags to retail stores, **accounting for the sold net bags in pcs**.  

Since it is not practically achievable for every bag to weight exactly the same, even more, have the exact nominal weight value, every bag's weight differs from the rest and deviates slightly from the nominal. 
This leads to differences in the accounting records between the full purchased quantity in bulk, and the full sold quantity in pieces, when converted and counted in the same unit of measurement - in this case - lbs. or kgs.  

Another company buys fresh fruits in bulk, which then goes to process and store for drying. 
The fruits naturally reduce their weight due to the drying process. 
The business then packages and sells the dried produce to retailers. 
Again, this leads to effective differences in the accounting records for the procured and sold quantities.  

## Industries That Typically Deal with Variable Measurement Ratios of Products

Variable Measurement Ratios are typical for industries specialized in **process manufacturing**, **dosing**, and **packaging**, such as food and beverage production, steel and aluminium processing, textile manufacturing, and many others. 
Their products require a **specialized solution** which can take into account **all specific cases and details**.  

## @@name's Solution

The Warehouse Management System of @@name is **designed to fully support** handling products with variable measurement ratios. 
The mobile application allows **entering the weight measured** for any piece of product that is subject to warehouse operations.  
The data for these products and operations is stored **directly in the integrated database** of @@name and gets **transferred through the whole dataflow**, acting on the inventory management system's **records**, and respectively, on the **warehouse transactions** for these activities.
