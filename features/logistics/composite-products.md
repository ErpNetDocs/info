# Composite Products

## Overview

There are industries (like furniture and fixtures) where businesses are accustomed to storing, handling, and distributing **products composed of individual parts or components** that may be stored and manipulated **separately** from one another. 
Since these components comprise the final distributed and sold product, their full set is treated as a **single product** and must be managed accordingly.  

@@name is armed with the **Composite Products** feature to **meet all needs** and help **overcome all challenges** when dealing with composite products.  

## Examples of Composite Products

The **furniture manufacturing and distribution** businesses are just some key examples of industries that **rely heavily on composite products** to run their operations. 
Furniture and fixture items are typical products which require an ERP-CRM system that is fully capable of **defining**, **managing**, and **selling** such products. 

Many other businesses, like those trading desktop and server configurations, HVAC (heat, ventilation, and air conditioning), and windows and doors mechanisms and systems, necessitate proper business management solutions and strategies just as much.
