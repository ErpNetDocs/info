Whether these are:

* requisitions and orders for shipment (from the CRM subsystem)
* requests for material input (from the Production subsystem)
* orders for transfer to other warehouses (from the Logistic subsystem)

WMS keeps track of **all types of tasks** to provide **on-time fulfillment** and never allow downtime in production or delays in shipments due to unacceptable waiting periods.  

Orders for:

* material procurement
* receipt of purchased goods 
* orders for putting materials into production
* receiving products from other stores  

are executed in the same manner.  

## Warehouse Structure and Storage Space

With the help of the **WMS software system**, you can accurately **recreate your physical warehouse** as a **hierarchical structure** of **storage locations**. 
WMS enables you to **define precise storage locations** for your products and arrange them in **shelves**, **racks**, **aisles**, **zones**, **warehouses**, and others. 
This way, the system can provide **navigated deployment** and **picking** of products from a warehouse, as well as **receipt**, **storage**, and **issuing goods for delivery**.  
WMS software system is able to **direct warehouse workers** to specific **storage locations** where the new products are suitable to be stored or goods are to be shipped.  

The Warehouse Management Module also supports **stocking, storing, moving, and dispatching** product quantities in **lots**, allowing the user to **consider the expiration date** (in case products have one) to avoid being left with dead stock.  

## Warehouse Policies

You can define **warehouse policies** throughout your **hierarchical structure**. 
Warehouse policies are used in order to **set the rules, restrictions, and possibilities** when carrying out warehouse operations. 
The policies are designed with **exceptional flexibility**, so as such, they can be applied either **generally** for the whole warehouse or **partially** for the various storage locations, zones, product groups, and many other divisions of your **storage space**.

## Warehouse Tasks and Activities

The Warehouse Management System enables warehouse managers and supervisors to **order and track the progress** on various tasks carried out by warehouse workers.  
Tasks include **receive, move, label, count, inspect, kit, assemble, dispatch**, and many other types.  
**Warehouse order details** like warehouse zones and locations, products and product variants, lots, serial numbers, logistic units, workers assigned to, and other important attributes are taken into account when **assigning** or **reviewing** tasks.
