# Inventory Control

## Overview

Many businesses operating small or uncomplicated storage spaces run **simple daily operations** within them. 

Shops and retail stores, functioning as standalone stores or retail chains, are examples of places that perform **basic storage manipulations**. 
These are usually **replenishing stocks**, **counting available articles**, and **issuing sold products** from the inventory.  

Introduced in v.2024, **@@name** brings the **Inventory Control** mobile app - the solution enabling you and your staff to execute all these regular operations in your platform **quickly and efficiently**.  

## Running a more productive store

The basic actions associated with the inventory of your store may be relatively simple, but these occupy **a significant part of your employees' workday**.  

Retail stores and other simplified storage spaces go through several basic processes with their stock:  

* **Receiving goods** from suppliers or from other stores 
* **Issuing goods** that are sold to customers or moved to other stores 
* **Counting stock** in the storage area and on the shelves 
* **Transferring goods** from one store to another
* **Scrap stock** that is damaged beyond sale, missing from your physical store, past its expiry date, or your store simply no longer needs it.  

These processes are an essential part of your shop or retail business. 
But their repetitive nature can be tiring and time-consuming.  

Cutting down on the time spent doing these leaves more time for other important and productive activities. 
Implementing a solution that helps with menial operations is a way to achieve this.  

**Inventory Control** streamlines these processes and lets your team focus on **serving your customers** and **consulting them on their needs**. 

As a result, your crew is able to direct their efforts at **increasing the quality of your services**.

Bringing up the built-in report of frequently used quantities allows you to view and print barcodes that represent these.  

Use quantity barcodes to speed up your work tremendously - **print them** and **stick them conveniently** in your work area (on a wall, rack, or desk) where you process goods.  

> [!TIP]
> 
> When your store receives, sells, or counts 100 chocolates or 50 packs of coffee all at once, your staff needs to scan just 2 barcodes.
> 
> Just scan the appropriate quantity barcode (50 or 100) and the app will load and apply this quantity to your next scanned product. 
> Then, scan the product - and you are done.
