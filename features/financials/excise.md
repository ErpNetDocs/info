# Excise Management module

## Overview

The production and distribution of alcohol products is an **exciting and lucrative market**. 
As a specialized industry, it comes with many distinct challenges.  

Aside from the various challenges typically met in the production and distribution sectors, companies dealing with alcohol products face **branch-specific challenges**. 
Some of the most notable of these are related to **complying with regulations and reporting to authorities**.  

Unlike many other business fields, **the production and distribution of alcohol are strictly regulated**. 
Authorities like state institutions and international regulatory agencies mandate businesses to **meticulously prepare**, **store**, and **present documentation** about their operations with alcoholic materials and goods.  

This means a huge number of processes and sets of data, emerging from them, have to be **tracked, recorded, and processed**. 
In addition, businesses must **regularly create and finalize documents** observing rigorous rules and laws, and **report these documents to the excise tax authorities**. 

Learn how **@@name's Excise Management module** can assist you in smoothly overcoming all these challenges. 
The module is designed to **facilitate data collection, processing, and management** in order to help you with **reporting to authorities**. 
Using **Excise module of @@name** takes a lot of effort off your business and helps you ensure it **remains in compliance** with the active legislation.  

## Experience and functionality in one

Alcohol beverages are most often than not subject to excise tax. 
Companies producing and selling alcoholic beverages **must keep documentation** in accordance with long lists of codes, purposes, operations, and categories of products that fall under excise tax laws. 

State requirements are easier to comply with when your business has a solution that encompasses **the necessary functionality under one roof**.  

@@name combines years of experience, development, and best practices built into it. 
The platform offers all the necessary means for your company to **reduce the efforts on operating and documenting** the materials, goods, and processes used in the production and trade of alcohol.  

The Excise module of @@name enables you to **create and manage administrative documentation** about raw materials for alcoholic products, semi-finished goods, and finished products.  

## Managing excise products in @@name

Due to the rigorous regulations applied to them, excise products cannot be stored in ordinary stores and warehouses, alongside other random products. 
These products are kept in a special type of store, called a **tax warehouse**.  

The **Tax Warehouse** functionality in @@name allows you to assign a physical store or a group of stores as a tax warehouse, that is designated especially for the movement and storage of excise-taxed products.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Some alcohol products are taxed with zero-rate excise duty.
> Producers and distributors do not pay excise tax on these products when they release them from the tax warehouse.
> Nevertheless, these alcohol products are still subject to the same laws and regulations, and as such, are required to be present in administrative documentation for excise tax authorities.  

Depending on the specific countries they are located in, tax warehouses can be required to operate with **measuring devices** installed on each of the **entry** and **exit points**. 
These devices **record each alcohol item's parameters** (such as quantity, alcohol proof, time of transaction, etc.) when **coming in** or **going out** of the store.  

@@name enables you to **save the devices** and **the transactions recorded by them** within the system to incorporate them in the regular reports.  

The **Excise** module gives you the opportunity to **organize your excise products** with respect to their **codes**, **purposes**, **categories**, **duty rates**, and other crucial attributes mandatory for creating administrative documentation.  

## Excise stamp operations and lots

**Alcohol products** that are charged with excise tax **are required to be affixed with an excise stamp** designated for **every particular product**. 
@@name features functionality for tracking and managing **stamp lots** and **stamp operations** for excise products.  

The system helps you trace the usage of stamp lots and the operations they went under **for each excise product**, **tax warehouse**, and **enterprise company**. 
This information is grouped, summarized, and included in the periodic reports.
