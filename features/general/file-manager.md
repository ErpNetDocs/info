 # File Management in @@name  
*A modern way to organize, access, and use your business documents*

---

## Documents are everywhere. And that’s perfectly normal.

Every business works with documents.
And not just a few.
Contracts, offers, invoices, specifications, spreadsheets, reports, images — they are part of every deal, every decision, and every operational activity, regardless of industry.

Interestingly, documents are rarely the “main topic.”
They simply need to be there — when you look for them, when you open them, and when you work with them.
As a business grows, this expectation becomes even more important.
More people, more processes, more information that needs to be:

- clearly organized  
- up to date  
- easy to access  
- logically connected to the work  

When documents are organized as part of the business context, work flows more naturally. Teams orient themselves faster, and the focus stays on tasks — not on searching.

This is exactly where **File Management in @@name** comes into play.

## One place for all files and documents

File Management in @@name brings documents to where work actually happens — inside the system itself.
Instead of existing separately, files are directly linked to:

- customers and suppliers  
- sales documents and invoices  
- projects and tasks  
- products, assets, and processes  

This means documents are always in the right place, in the right context, and at the right moment — without switching between systems or tools.

## Why integrated file management matters

At some point, every business reaches a clear but important conclusion:

**documents do not exist on their own.**

They are part of deals, projects, deliveries, inspections, analyses, and management decisions.
That is why it makes perfect sense for files to “live” where the business itself is managed.
File Management in @@name places documents in this context.
Files are not stored across separate servers, shared drives, or personal devices. Instead, they are logically connected within the system to customers, products, projects, deliveries, controls, and reports — directly within the business context.
This naturally changes the way people work:

- information is found where decisions are made  
- teams work with the same, up-to-date documents  
- relationships between files and business objects are maintained automatically  
- context is preserved over time, people, and organizational changes  

As a result, documents stop being “attachments” and become an active part of managing processes, resources, and responsibilities.
This is what makes File Management in @@name such a natural extension of the entire system — because businesses are managed best when all information is in one place and speaks the same language.
