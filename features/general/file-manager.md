# File Manager of ERP.net

## Overview

Oftentimes users have to search through complex directories to find a file they are looking for. 
Especially when the file is **not associated** to a **specific document or record** in the ERP system, buth is a rather more **generic document** for business use, such as documentation regarding training courses, internal or external regulations, company practices, handbooks, and so on.  

Users tend to keep such files in an external storage, like local drives or cloud platforms. But this often leaves a gap between navigating through internal ERP entities and external file storage.  

A **File Manager inside the ERP system** is a **feasible and productive way** to **close this gap** and **utilize the ERP system's full potential**.  

Your Business Management solution **@@name** comes with the updated functionality **File Management v2.0**.  

**File Manager of @@name** enables you to **store and access** your files and folders in an organized and straightforward way without having to attach them to specific records. 
Its intuitive structure resembles the well-known **Windows File Explorer structure** users are used to.  

The new functionality for organizing your work files and folders is accessible to all users of your @@name platform, regardless of their workplace's physical location.  
## File Manager Structure

**File Management v2.0** unlocks new opportunities by providing **a uniform, centralized and shared structure** for managing your business documentation in a cloud environment, integrated with the rest of your data within the ERP platform. 

**@@name's File Manager** uses a vertically-expandable **hierarchical tree structure** to arrange and represent your folders.

The **Files** window shows the files stored in the selected folder. It also allows to:

* Save the selected file to your local storage or external storage
* Delete the selected file(s)
* Upload new file(s) to your @@name File Manager storage
