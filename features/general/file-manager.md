# File Management in @@name
*Keep business documents reachable from the records where work happens — stored in @@name or referenced as links/URLs.*

---

## Value Proposition

File Management in @@name keeps documents reachable from the same business context where decisions and operations happen — a customer, a document, a project, a product, or a process.
The key principle is simple: files stay connected to ERP records through an explicit relationship, regardless of where the content is stored.

@@name supports multiple storage models without changing the user experience:

- files can be stored as **Embedded files** (content stored in @@name), or  
- maintained externally and referenced as **Linked files** or **Internet URLs** — while still remaining reachable from the relevant business record.

## Why This Matters

In real operations, documents are rarely “the main object” — but they are often the evidence and working material behind it: contracts for a deal, specifications for an order, photos for execution, certificates for quality, spreadsheets for analysis.
The recurring problem is not storage capacity.
It is **missing context**: a file exists somewhere (in a drive, email thread, chat, or personal folder), but the team cannot reliably reach it from:

- the customer record  
- the sales document  
- the project  
- the product or asset it refers to  

As organizations grow, this becomes structural. The same process involves more people, more handovers, and more auditability requirements — and *“I think it’s in someone’s folder”* stops being acceptable.

File Management in @@name addresses this by keeping the relationship between files and business objects explicit and reusable inside the ERP context.

## Key Capabilities

### Keep files in business context

Files can be attached to business records such as:

- customers and suppliers  
- sales documents and invoices  
- projects and tasks  
- products, assets, and processes  

This keeps documentation reachable from the record that already defines **why** the file matters.

### Support both record-related evidence and shared documentation

Not all files belong to a single transaction. File Management supports:

- **record-related files** — evidence, outputs, and attachments tied to a specific customer, project, or document  
- **shared folders** — templates, policies, and reference materials used across teams  

### Choose the storage model without losing ERP context

@@name supports three storage methods:

- **Embedded file** — stored in @@name  
- **Linked file** — a reference to a file stored elsewhere  
- **Internet URL** — a reference to an online location  

The guarantee stays the same: the file (or reference) remains reachable from the relevant business object.

### Open and edit from the ERP context (without changing how users work)

Users open files from the ERP record and work with them in the appropriate desktop application for the file type.

- For **Embedded files**, the content is stored and maintained in @@name.  
- For **Linked files** and **Internet URLs**, the content stays in its external location — @@name maintains the reference and the business context connection.

## How It Works

File Management combines two organizing principles:

1. Files can be attached to records (customer, project, document, product).  
2. Files can be organized in shared folders (when they are general reference).

For each file, you choose one of the supported storage methods — embedded, linked, or Internet URL — but the user experience remains consistent:  
find the file from the business record, open it, work with it in the right application, and keep it connected to the correct ERP context.

## Typical Scenarios / Use Cases

File Management in @@name adapts to work across teams and industries, for example:

- **Sales:** offers, contracts, and specifications reachable from the customer and sales documents  
- **Projects & operations:** drawings, reports, and execution photos reachable from the project and tasks  
- **Quality & control:** inspection evidence, certificates, and protocols reachable from deliveries, materials, and products  
- **Management:** decision-support materials reachable from the relevant initiative or kept in shared folders  
- **Company-wide references:** policies, handbooks, and templates stored in shared folders, not tied to one record

These examples reflect patterns seen across many organizations.

## Why @@name

This is not “file storage next to an ERP”.

The differentiator is the preserved business context:

- files remain reachable from the records people actually work with  
- the file-to-record relationship is explicit in the system, not dependent on personal folder conventions  
- the same concept applies consistently across business areas, so documentation does not become a separate tool and a separate habit  

In practice, this reduces the *“where is it?”* loop and makes documentation usable over time — even when teams change.
