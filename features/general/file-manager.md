# File Manager of ERP.net

## Overview

Oftentimes, keeping files in an external storage (like local drives or cloud platforms) leads to searching through complex external directories to find a file you are looking for. 
And this often leaves a gap between navigating through internal ERP entities and external file storage.  

**File Management inside the ERP system** is a **feasible and productive way** to **close this gap** and **utilize the ERP system's full potential**.  

**Some files** are associated with **a specific record** in the ERP system. 
They are an integral part of the record and make more sense if stored attached to it.  

To meet these needs, your **@@name system** provides you with the universal functionality of **attaching embedded or linked files** to an **internal record or other object**, available throughout all subsystems.  

**Other files** are more **generic documents for business use**, such as documentation regarding training courses, internal or external regulations, company practices, handbooks, and so on. 
These concern the organization as a whole and are used for **general reference** or as **informational sources**. 
In this case, being able to upload them in an accessible storage, **unattached**, would be a more suitable solution.  

To solve this, **@@name** now comes with the updated functionality **File Management v2.0**.  

Built upon the proven and trusted functionality of **attaching documents to specific objects**, **File Manager of @@name** now extends its abilities featuring a way to **also store an unattached file**.  

**File Manager** enables you to **store and access** your files and folders in an organized and straightforward way. 
Its intuitive structure resembles the well-known **Windows File Explorer structure** users are used to.  

The new functionality for organizing your work files and folders is accessible to all users of your @@name platform regardless of their workplace's physical location.  
## File Manager Structure

**File Management v2.0** unlocks new opportunities by providing **a uniform, centralized and shared structure** for managing your business documentation in a cloud environment, integrated with the rest of your data within the ERP platform. 

**@@name's File Manager** uses a vertically-expandable **hierarchical tree structure** to arrange and represent your folders.  

The **File tree** can be **expanded or collapsed** to **list or hide** subfolders for a more **detailed**, or conversely, a more **compact** layout.  
You can use the **folder tree** to easily **view your folders** and **navigate throughout your directories structure**.  

In the Folder tree you can also: 

* Edit the definition (name, parent, and notes) of the selected folder.
* Create a new folder
* Change the name of the selected folder
* Remove the selected folder from the folder tree and your storage
* Refresh the contents of the folder tree  

The **Files** window shows the files stored in the selected folder. 
It also allows to: 

* Open the selected file using an appropriate application
* Save the selected file to your local storage or external storage
* Delete the selected file(s)
* Upload new file(s) to your @@name File Manager storage

## File Manager Views 

The layout options for visualizing your files are identical to the popular ones in Windows File Explorer. 
**Different layouts** represent a **different level of density and details** for the files in the current folder. 
There are currently **eight available views** for viewing your documents. 
You can choose between different icon sizes, tiles, list, details, and other.

## File Manager Sections

While in **Details layout**, you can assign **sections** to your files. 

Sections will be shown in all other **layouts**. 
Each section is represented by **its name and a horizontal line**, separating it from other sections. 
This way the systems groups all of your files belonging to the same section. 

By using sections, you can **organize your files** in a **neat and convenient for you way** to **navigate visually** throughout them even faster. 

## Uploading Files to Your File Manager Storage

You can store all types of files in your **@@name File Manager Storage**. 
You can even **select multiple files for upload** and then upload them **all at once**.  

Files can be uploaded and stored in your **@@name storage** using one of the available **three storage methods**:  

* **Embedded file** - your file's **full contents** are uploaded to your **@@name storage**  
* **Linked file** - allows you to create **a shortcut** linked to the **physical location of the file** (a physical drive with shared access, or its shared partition or folder)  
* **Internet URL** - create **a shortcut** linked to **an object located on the Internet** using a URL (for example, a shortcut to a website opened by your browser)  

The **Embedded file** option is best suitable for **small-sized file** that are **frequently used** by your @@name instance's users.  

**Linked file** is a solution suitable for **larger-sized files** located on a **shared resource** accessible to your users, saving space on your @@name database.  

And **Internet URL** is a great option for working with **very large-sized files** which are located **on your external cloud storage**, as well as accessing resources **readily available on the Internet**.
