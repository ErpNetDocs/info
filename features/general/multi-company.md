# Manage multiple companies

@@name instances can be used to manage the operations of multiple legal entities.
There is no need to create separate instances for each managed company.

A company, managed in the ERP instance is called "Enterprise Company".

## Shared definitions and settings

The definitions in @@name can be shared between the enterprise companies.

For example, shared product definitions can really help companies, which are trading with each other.

Sharing the document type and process definitions can be really helpful, when establishing the same procedures in the different enterprise companies.

Generally, sharing the definitions and settings helps managing multiple legal entities as one whole business.

## Automatic trade between the enterprise companies

When an enterprise company sells to another company in the enterprise, @@name can automatically generate the purchase on the other side.
This can even be automated with document routes.

This can be defined as automatic business rule.
