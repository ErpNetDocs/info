# Enter stop

Did you what to skip to the important fields without touching the mouse? 
With ERP.net you can get right to the important data entry in a form with Enter Stop. This allows you to press enter and move to the next field in a predefined list.  

When you press enter in a field, you will move straight to the next important entry. 

## A long form with many fields

For example, when you enter new sales order, the form may contain a lot of fields, which are not relevant to your role. 
In this case we just select a few fields and when we press enter we will quick move to them, skipping all the rest.
