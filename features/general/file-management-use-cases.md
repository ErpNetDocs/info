# How businesses use File Management in ERP.net

*Real-world scenarios across teams, industries, and processes*

File Management in ERP.net adapts to how work is actually done in a company — from daily commercial activities, through project and operational work, to control, reporting, and management decisions.

Documents are created, reviewed, shared, and referenced every day — in sales conversations, on customer sites, during inspections, within projects, audits, and management reviews.

What makes File Management in ERP.net different is not just **where** files are stored, but **how naturally they become part of everyday work**.

Below are real-world scenarios that show how different teams use File Management in ERP.net — not as a separate tool, but as an integrated part of their business processes.

## Sales teams and merchandising

Sales teams and merchandisers use File Management as a natural extension of their fieldwork.

Photos of stocked shelves, store layouts, product placement, execution of agreed commercial conditions, and visual information from customer visits are stored directly with the respective customer, site, or sales activity.

This enables:
- a clear visual history of customer relationships  
- fast feedback between field teams and office teams  
- better control and traceability of execution  

Files and images remain where they have business value — not on personal devices or in disconnected chats.

## Project, operational, and technical teams

Project and operational teams use File Management to maintain all project and technical documentation within the flow of real work.

Specifications, drawings, instructions, machine files, execution reports, site photos, and work-stage images are stored directly with the project, task, or specific process.

This is especially valuable for:
- work on sites  
- phased execution of activities  
- infrastructure projects  
- coordination between multiple teams  

Documentation stays consistent and accessible to everyone involved, regardless of the project stage.

## Incoming and outgoing control

In companies with defined incoming and outgoing control processes, File Management in ERP.net plays a key role in documenting and tracking quality across the entire chain.

During incoming inspection of raw materials and supplies, employees perform checks based on predefined acceptance criteria. When deviations or nonconformities are identified, they are documented through reports accompanied by photos and supporting files.

With File Management:
- reports, images, and records are stored in one place  
- documentation stays linked to a specific delivery, material, or supplier  
- information is accessible to Quality, Procurement, and Management  

Outgoing control follows the same approach. Quality certificates, inspection reports, photos, and accompanying documents are stored with specific products, batches, deliveries, or customers.

The result is complete traceability — from material receipt to final delivery — structured, accessible, and reusable.

## Quality management

The Quality department uses File Management in ERP.net as a centralized environment for managing documentation and quality-related activities.

Inspection reports, internal audit results, images, nonconformity records, and corrective actions are stored in context — connected to specific processes, deliveries, or projects.

At the same time, all ISO documentation — quality policies, general procedures, system instructions, register templates, and forms — is managed centrally and consistently.

This transforms ISO certification from a formal requirement into a working part of daily operations:
- management gains visibility into implementation and compliance  
- employees work with procedures in their real work context  
- adoption is easier and more sustainable across the organization

## Companies providing services and specialized analyses

For companies offering engineering, laboratory, or certification services, File Management supports working with large volumes of specialized documentation.

Measurement files, reports, images, and results from analyses, tests, and inspections are stored centrally with the relevant order, analysis, or customer.

This ensures that:
- all service-related information is in one place  
- different file formats and sources are logically combined  
- documentation is easy to track, reuse, and audit over time  

This is especially important for recurring analyses, certifications, and traceability requirements.

## Accounting and finance

Accounting and finance teams use File Management to maintain structured and reliable documentation.

Invoices, payment documents, contracts, and finalized reports can be organized by year, period, or any structure aligned with internal policies and regulatory requirements.

Documents are:
- clearly organized  
- easy to find  
- linked to specific financial records  
- ready for audits, inspections, and reporting  

---

## Management and leadership

For management, File Management in ERP.net provides clarity and confidence.

Key documents, reports, contracts, records, and visual information are available quickly, in a structured way, and always in the context of real business activities.

This enables:
- better-informed decisions  
- easier control without operational micromanagement  
- visibility into processes, projects, and quality  
- confidence that information is reliable and up to date  

For decision-makers, this is not just convenience — it is a foundation for effective management.

## One system, many ways of working

These examples show one simple thing:

File Management in ERP.net is not designed for a single role or industry.  
It adapts to how work is actually done — in the office, on site, in quality control, in services, and at management level.

Documents, images, reports, and records stay connected to the business context they belong to — making information easier to use, easier to trust, and easier to manage over time.
