# International Enterprises

@@name supports applying multiple legislations in one ERP instance.

When a business spans multiple jurisdictions (countries), different legislations can govern the different parts of the enterprise.
The feature allows the different [managed legal entities](multi-company.md) to be based on different legislations.

## How the legislation is applied

Generally, the legislation is primarily based on the company, managed with the ERP solution.
However, it is possible that sales to foreign clients must follow different rules.

It is also possible that in some cases multiple legislations (federal or EU) apply together with local regulations.

## Automation with business rules

Using the [Business Rules Engine](xref:business-rules), the processes in an enterprise can be automated.
Different rules can be set, depending on the applicable legislation for the buyer and seller.

This can be very useful for automating international trade.
