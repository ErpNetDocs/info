# Documents

## Value proposition

In everyday work, responsibility often starts with a document.
Offers, orders, invoices, cases, activities — they move through teams and roles, and someone is expected to take care of what comes next.

The practical challenge is not creating documents.
It is keeping track of the documents you are responsible for, especially when they span multiple modules and business processes.

## Why this matters

In many organizations, responsibility for a document is real work.
Someone must complete the administrative details, keep the document moving, and respond when something changes.
When that responsibility is tracked only informally, documents get “stuck” in the gaps between departments and tools.

The **Assigned to user** field exists to make that responsibility explicit.
It defines who is expected to take care of the document’s administrative completion and progression.
Documents in @@name turns this responsibility into a visible, manageable personal queue.

## Key capabilities

**A personal list of what you are responsible for.**
Documents shows the documents where **Assigned to user** points to the current user.
This brings together responsibility across modules in one place, so the next administrative step is not lost in navigation.

**A clear handover mechanism.**  
When a document is assigned to another colleague, it appears in their Documents list.
This makes handover explicit.
Responsibility is moved in the system, not forwarded in chat.

**Fast orientation across many document types.**  
The same list can include different document types from different parts of @@name.
This makes Documents useful for users who touch many flows during the day, such as operations, administration, finance, sales, and team leads.

**Find and review without opening everything.**  
Documents is designed for triage.
Users can review what requires attention, then open the exact document when action is needed, without searching through separate module menus.

**Work with the list as a working view, not as a static inbox.**  
The Documents list supports sorting, filtering, grouping, and saved views, so users can organize it around the way they work.
A frequently used view can be saved as a Tile for quick repeat access.

**Share and coordinate when a document becomes a team topic.**  
When responsibility or a decision needs input, the document list supports sharing and coordination patterns, so the right people can be brought into context without copying information into separate tools.

## How it works (high level)

Documents is driven by assignment.
Each @@name document can have an **Assigned to user** value.
When that value points to you, the document becomes part of your personal Documents list.

This keeps responsibility simple and visible.
If you create a document and it is assigned to you, it appears in your list by default.
If responsibility is moved to another user, the same document moves to their list, and it no longer depends on someone remembering to forward links or messages.

## Typical scenarios / use cases

**Administrative follow-up across modules.**  
A user is responsible for multiple documents across sales, logistics, finance, and internal coordination.
Documents provides one place to see what is assigned to them, so work does not depend on opening separate module lists.

**A clean responsibility handover.**  
A document is prepared by one role and then handed over for completion to another role.
Instead of “please handle this” messages, the document is assigned to the next responsible user, and it becomes part of their Documents list.

**Daily triage before deep work.**  
A user starts the day by reviewing their assigned documents.  
They decide which items require immediate action, which can wait, and which require coordination, and then open only the documents that need work now.

**Coordination when a document becomes a shared topic.**  
A document requires input from a colleague or a team.  
The user shares the document context and continues the work with the right people involved, without duplicating information into external tools.

## Why @@name

Documents works because it is part of @@name, not a separate “inbox tool”.
It uses the same business objects, the same access rights, and the same document context as the rest of the platform.

This makes responsibility stable and explainable.
The **Assigned to user** field is not a personal tag.
It is a platform-level concept that can be applied consistently across modules and document types.

As a result, Documents gives users a reliable personal view of responsibility, while the organization keeps a consistent source of truth for who is expected to move each document forward.
