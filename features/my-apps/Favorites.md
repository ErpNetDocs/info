# Favorites

## Overview

The “Favorites” section gathers all the business objects that you want to follow closely at your fingertips.  
These are items you’ve selected that you want to keep just one click away.  
This way, you can access them easily at any time.  
A “Favorite” could be: a product offer, a company representative you contact frequently, an industry you want to keep a close eye on, an ongoing campaign, a competitor, etc.

## Why It’s Worth It

The idea of having favorite objects to follow stems out from the way our brain works for decision-making.
We come across different objects every single day (documents, ideas, etc.), then our mind goes through a rapid evaluation process.  
It weights how useful every new thing is. 
The ones that are most useful for us soon become something that we want to keep at hand.

By keeping certain things at hand, “Favorites” saves your time and makes it easy for you to reach the items you want to follow. 
You won’t let them sink in between hundreds or thousands of other items of the same type.

## How it Works

In ERP.net (v26.2 and above), objects can be followed at different levels:

- Tagged

- Following

- Favorite

Objects marked as „Favorite“ appear in „My Favorites.”

An item you want to follow closely – be it a document, a contact person, campaign or company – can be favorized by clicking the “Add to Favorites” mark on the top-right corner. 
It is accompanied by a star, too.

All favorite items enter a single „collection area” called “Favorites”.  
It is just one click away from your login. 
It’s meant to show all Favorites on a single screen.

Favorites are automatically grouped by type. 
As a result, they appear in columns, each with a title, that represent the respective source categories, e.g. Campaigns, Customers, Offers, etc. 

__Real-time notifications__: Whenever something happens in the context of an object you marked as Favorite, you can receive notifications. 
This happens when an event or update occurs, e.g. a mention, a comment, etc. 
A badge displays the count of available new notifications. 
The follow level influences what notifications you receive.

__Easy management__: Wherever you are inside the system, whatever app you use, whatever document you read, write or edit – you will see an “Add to Favorites” icon on the top right corner, together with a star. 
It is there to let the user start following the item.

Almost all types of items can be followed and potentially become “Favorites”. 
What cannot be marked as a "Favorite" are items that are intermittent or temporary by essence, such as chats or calendar appointments.

## What This Means for You

## Is “Favorites” different from “Tiles”?

Although “Favorites” look visually similar to “Tiles”, they are functionally different.
“Tiles” stores your frequently used multiple-filter selections, whilst “Favorites” keeps frequently used items. 
This means a single item can only be a "Favorite" and not a "Tile", while a filtered selection can be saved as a "Tile".

## Verdict

“Favorites” saves the items that you visit often or want to keep close for frequent reference. 
Instead of navigating through all the menus each time you want to access an item, you can simply place it the “Favorites” so when you can reach with one click after your login.

It is as easy as putting a pin on the corkboard. 
Unpinning is that easy too.
