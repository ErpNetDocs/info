# Favorites

## Overview

The “Favorites” section gathers all your favorite business objects at your fingertips. 
These are selected-by-you items that you want to keep just one click away. 
Access them easily at any time. 
These could be: the best product offer, a company representative you contact frequently, an industry you want to keep close eye on, a campaign, competitor, etc.

## Why is it Worth

The idea of having favorites stems out from the way our brain works for decision-making.
We come across different objects every single day (documents, ideas, etc.), then our mind goes through a rapid evaluation process. 
It weights how useful every new thing is. 
The ones that are useful for us soon become something that we want to keep at hand. 

So “Favorites” saves your time and makes it easy for you to touch the items you find very useful. 
You won’t let them sink in between hundreds or thousands of other items of the same type.

## How it Works

Every single item – be it a document, a contact person, an internal application, campaign or company – can be favorized. 
You only need to check it as a Favorite by clicking the “Add to Favorites” mark in the side panel at the top right corner. 
It is accompanied by a star, too.

All favorite items enter a single “Favorites” plain. 
It is just one click away from your login.

Favorites are automatically grouped by types. 
Hence, they will appear in groups (e.g. columns or rows), each with a title, that represent the respective source category, e.g. Campaigns, Customers, Offers, etc. 

Why would one mark items as Favorites? 
In our everyday work we happen to deal with certain items repetitevly. 
For instance, a sales person may want to keep a close eye on a Customer that is wuite important for some reason, or a marketing representative may want to closely follow a certain campaign.  

__Real Time Notifications__: As there might be some changes to your favorites, done by other people in your organization, a notification will pop up beside the respective item. 
Every Favorite item has a notification marker on its top right corner. 
It is a small circle that shows the number of new notifications.

__Easy Management__: Wherever you are inside the system, whatever app you use, whatever document you read, write or edit – you will see an “Add to Favorites” icon on the top right corner, together with a star. 
Click it and the item enters the “Favorites” plain immediately.

Almost all types of items can become “Favorites”. 
What cannot be added are items that are intermittent or temporary by essence, such as chats or calendar appointments.

## Is “Favorites” different from “Tiles”?

Although “Favorites” look visually similar to “Tiles”, they are functionally different.
“Tiles” stores your frequently used multiple-filter selections, whilst “Favorites” keeps frequently used items. 
This means a single item can only be a "Favorite" and not a "Tile", while a filtered selection can be saved as a "Tile".

## Verdict

“Favorites” saves the items that you visit often or want to keep close for frequent reference. 
Instead of navigating through all the menus each time you want to access an item, you can simply place it the “Favorites” so when you can reach with one click after your login.

It is as easy as putting a pin on the corkboard. 
Unpinning is that easy too.
