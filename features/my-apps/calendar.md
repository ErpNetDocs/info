# My Calendar in @@name

## Value proposition

My Calendar in @@name is your personal view of time.  
It helps you plan and follow your own appointments and commitments, in the same environment where your work lives.  

My Calendar is not only a visual schedule.  
It is a practical way to keep personal engagements visible, while also staying aligned with the activities that involve you across teams and groups.

## Why this matters

A workday is shaped as much by time as by tasks.  
Even when work is well organized, people lose momentum when commitments are spread across places and the schedule is reconstructed repeatedly.  

My Calendar gives you one place to see what you have today, this week, or over the next period.  
It supports personal planning while keeping you connected to the activities that matter to you in the organization.

## Key capabilities

**Personal commitments in a dedicated calendar view.**  
My Calendar allows you to create and track activities that represent your personal appointments and time commitments.  
This makes “I will do it later” concrete in time, not only in intention.  

**Group activities are summarized, without flooding your personal calendar.**  
My Calendar sums up activities from the Social Groups you participate in.  
At the same time, group activities where you are not involved do not clutter your personal view.  
An activity appears in your personal calendar when you are a Participant, a Responsible Party, or an Owner of that activity.  

**Multiple views for different time horizons.**  
My Calendar supports different views, such as Month, Workweek, and Timeline.  
This makes it easier to switch between “today’s schedule” and “what is coming next” without changing the underlying data.  

**Fast navigation across time.**  
You can move across days, weeks, months, and longer periods to review past commitments or preview upcoming ones.  
This is useful when planning work that spans more than a single day.  

**Calendar as a widget, not only as a page.**  
My Calendar can be used as a standalone My App, and it can also be visualized as a widget panel.  
This allows calendar context to be available where users already work, instead of being a separate destination.

## How it works (high level)

My Calendar visualizes your activities in @@name.
It provides an easy way to review your schedule in different time views and navigate across periods.

My Calendar also consolidates activities from Social Groups you take part in.
Your personal calendar stays relevant because it includes the group activities that involve you, not everything happening in every group.

## Typical scenarios / use cases

**Block time for personal commitments.**  
A user creates a personal activity for an appointment, a deadline, or a focused work block.
The commitment becomes visible on the calendar, so planning is based on real time availability.  

**Stay aligned with team activity without losing your personal schedule.**  
A user participates in activities created in Social Groups.
My Calendar brings those activities into the personal view, so the user sees the full picture of what they are involved in.  

**Plan the week with a longer time horizon.**  
A user switches to a week or timeline view to see upcoming commitments and avoid collisions.
This supports realistic planning when work spans multiple days. 

**Use calendar context while working elsewhere.**  
A user opens My Calendar as a widget panel in a working form.
They can stay oriented in time without leaving the context of their current work.

## Why @@name

My Calendar is part of @@name, which means it follows the same access rules and context as the rest of the platform.
Group membership and participation determine what you can see, and personal visibility stays consistent as teams and groups change.  

Because My Calendar is built around the same activity concept used across @@name, the calendar view remains explainable.
What you see is tied to real records and participation, not to copied entries from disconnected tools.
