No matter what we do, we repeatedly come across a **number of small tasks** every day.
These quick jobs usually **appear spontaneously** and tend to **gradually stack up**.
With so many important activities it is easy to forget some routine duties to the side.

Well-built work processes rely on more persistent and dependable tools than human memory.
For that, **@@name** adds a brand-new application to its integrated app suite: **To Do**.

The new **To Do** is a **personal reminder tool**.
Its purpose is to remind you to tend to some issues or pending jobs later.
In this manner, it lets you focus on **the more productive aspects** of the business.

## Why this matters

In day-to-day operations, tasks appear from different directions.
Some are personal reminders.
Some are assigned inside team collaboration.
Some are consequences of a bigger record, like a document, an activity, or a Case.

When those small commitments are scattered across chat messages, notes, and mental lists, the cost is not only missed tasks.
The cost is constant re-checking and re-building of context.

To Do provides a single, personal place to keep small actions explicit, reviewable, and close to the work they relate to.

> [!NOTE]  
> **To Dos** are meant to be **simple** and **easily readable reminders**.  
> The **full set of information** necessary for the job is usually **stored elsewhere**.  
> Other apps and functionalities of the system are used for **task management and project management**.  

**To Do reminders** usually involve **taking quick actions** to **accomplish simple goals**, such as "call Janine today", "Review the new safety procedure", "Schedule a meeting for the team", and so on.  

@@name enables you to **assign To Dos to yourself** or **anyone else in your group** responsible for the job.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To Dos are usually given just some hints and small pieces of data to remind you of a pending duty.
> As they function **as a neat personal reminder**, they are usually **kept assigned to their owner**.

## Key capabilities

**A lightweight task layer, with a clear boundary.**  
To Do is designed for small commitments that should be tracked, but do not justify turning everything into a structured project item.
When work becomes complex and needs richer process, @@name provides advanced work management elsewhere, while To Do stays intentionally simple.

**Tasks can come from multiple sources, but still land in one list.**  
A To Do can be created as a personal reminder.  
A To Do can be assigned through a Social Group, so team follow-ups remain visible to the assignee.
A To Do can also be linked to a host record, such as a document, an activity, or a Case, so the reminder stays connected to the underlying work.

**Context is visible when the task is linked to real work.**  
When a To Do is linked to a host record, it indicates that relationship and provides direct navigation to the record.
This keeps “what to do next” connected to “what this is about”.

**Two views for the same tasks: list and flow.**  
To Do supports a List view for quick scanning and completion.
It also supports a Kanban view for managing flow across task states.

**Clear task states for everyday execution.**  
Tasks move through practical states such as New, In progress, Waiting, and Completed.
This keeps “what is blocked” and “what is done” visible without inventing extra process.

**Sorting and triage for busy days.**  
The To Do list supports sorting, including multi-level sorting, so users can order tasks by the criteria that matter today.
This is especially useful when tasks come from different sources and need quick prioritization.

## How it works (high level)

To Do tasks can be created as standalone reminders or as follow-ups connected to other work.
Tasks can include optional scheduling details such as reminders and due dates, so “later” becomes explicit.
Tasks can also be assigned to other users, and in Social Groups this supports lightweight delegation inside the team context.

To Do is also designed around visibility of linked tasks.
Tasks that are linked to host records are available in the To Do application by default, so follow-ups connected to real work are not hidden behind a separate mode.

## Typical scenarios / use cases

**Capture a promise without creating overhead.**  
A user receives a quick request in the middle of another activity.  
They create a To Do as a lightweight reminder, so the request becomes an explicit commitment rather than a message to remember later.

**Turn a message into a task inside team collaboration.**  
A team discusses a next step in a Social Group.  
A To Do is assigned to the responsible colleague, and it appears in their personal To Do list as well, so the commitment is visible without copying it into another tool.

**Keep follow-ups connected to real work.**  
A user opens a document or a Case and realizes there is a small action that must happen later.  
They create or review a linked To Do, so the reminder stays connected to the host record and can be opened directly when it is time to act.

**Triage the day with sorting.**  
A user has personal To Dos, group-assigned To Dos, and To Dos linked to records.  
They sort the list in multiple levels to bring the most relevant items to the top, then work through the day with fewer interruptions and less re-checking.

## Why @@name

To Do works inside @@name, which means it stays connected to the same business objects and access rules as the rest of the platform.  
This is what makes linked To Dos practical rather than cosmetic.

A follow-up can point to a real record, and the user can open the context directly, without maintaining duplicate task systems.  
Because Social Groups and To Do are part of the same My Apps workspace, personal tasks and team-assigned tasks can coexist in one personal view.

This reduces fragmentation without forcing users into heavy process for small work.
