Well-built work processes rely on more persistent and dependable tools than human memory. 
For that, **@@name** adds a brand-new application to its integrated app suite: **To Do**.  

The new **To Do** is a **personal reminder tool**. 
Its purpose is to remind you to tend to some issues or pending jobs later.
