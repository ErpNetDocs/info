# My Apps in @@name

## Value proposition

Most workdays already have everything they need: tasks to complete, people to coordinate with, meetings to attend, and information to follow up on.
The real challenge is keeping all of that connected, so the day does not turn into constant switching and rebuilding of context.  

My Apps is the personal workspace in @@name.
It is a suite of focused applications for the daily work that sits between “ERP data” and “getting things done”.
It helps users keep tasks, communication, schedule, documents, and frequently used views close to the same business context they work with.

My Apps is not a separate tool that duplicates information.
It is a set of apps inside @@name that operate on the same platform concepts, access rights, and business objects.
That is what makes the workspace reliable and explainable over time.

## Why this matters

Most organizations already have tools for chat, documents, reminders, and scheduling.
The problem usually appears in the gaps between them.
When tasks live in one place, files in another, and decisions in a third, coordination becomes a manual activity.
People start compensating with forwarding, copy‑pasting, and “just ping me when it changes”.

My Apps addresses this by keeping personal work in the same environment where business work is managed.
Communication, tasks, documents, events, and the data they reference can stay connected rather than scattered across unrelated systems.
That reduces the effort of rebuilding context and makes day‑to‑day coordination less dependent on memory and informal follow‑ups.

## Key capabilities

**A single place to start and stay oriented.**  
Dashboard provides a personal landing point that can surface the items and views a user needs to see frequently.
It does not replace the underlying applications.
It brings them together so the day can start from one place without losing meaning or context.

**Team context that stays attached to the conversation.**  
Team Collaboration is built around chat groups.
A group can be as small as a conversation with one colleague, or as broad as a team, a department, or a cross‑functional workstream.
Inside a group, people can discuss, make video calls, and exchange files in a shared space that remains available over time.
This becomes especially valuable when collaboration is continuous and decisions should remain reviewable, not just mentioned once and then lost in private messages.

**Personal control of small commitments, without turning everything into a “project task”.**  
To Do provides a simple, explicit place to capture reminders and small actions.
@@name also supports more advanced work management for complex tasks and structured execution.
The value of To Do is that it gives users a lightweight way to mark and track follow‑ups without introducing extra overhead when the work is small, quick, or personal.

**A schedule that reflects all real commitments.**  
Calendar brings together meetings, appointments, and time‑bound commitments in one view.
Its added value is consolidation.
Commitments can come from different channels and groups, but the user can see them in one place as a single schedule.
When an Outlook calendar is synchronized, those Outlook events can also appear in the same calendar view, so the day is not split across separate calendars.

**Documents where responsibility is explicit.**  
Documents is not “all files”.
In this context, Documents is the list of @@name documents where the current user is the responsible person, meaning the document is assigned to them through the “Assigned to user” responsibility.
This allows users to follow and work on all documents they are accountable for, across modules, without jumping between different functional areas to find what needs attention.
The benefit is practical: responsibility becomes a personal queue that stays visible and manageable.

**Awareness without constant checking.**  
Notifications provide a controlled way to stay informed about what changed, what requires attention, and what involves the user.
The goal is not more noise.
The goal is fewer missed changes and fewer routines built around manual status checking.

**Fast access to repeatable questions.**  
Tiles provide saved views of information that users and teams return to repeatedly.
A tile captures what to look at, and it stays available as a stable shortcut when the same question appears again tomorrow.

## How it works (high level)

My Apps is designed around a simple daily loop.
Users start from an overview, coordinate with others, execute small follow‑ups, manage time, stay aware of changes, and return to key views without recreating navigation paths.

Dashboard acts as the entry point and can surface the relevant parts of the workspace.
Team Collaboration provides shared group spaces when coordination and decisions are needed.
To Do and Calendar keep commitments explicit in two complementary forms, actions and time.
Documents gathers the documents the user is responsible for across modules into one place.
Notifications reduce the need for manual checking.
Tiles provide stable, repeatable access to important views of information.

## Typical scenarios / use cases

**Start the day with orientation.**  
A user opens Dashboard to review what requires attention today.
From there, they move to the relevant app, a meeting in Calendar, a follow‑up in To Do, a responsibility queue in Documents, or a saved view in Tiles, without switching systems.

**Coordinate work that involves more than one person.**  
A team uses Team Collaboration groups as shared spaces for discussion, calls, and file exchange.
Instead of scattering decisions across private threads, the conversation remains available to the people who need it, in the same group context.

**Handle a high volume of small commitments.**  
To Do keeps micro‑tasks explicit and reviewable without turning them into heavy, structured work items.
Instead of “remembering later”, the user has a stable place to capture, revisit, and close small follow‑ups.

**See the day as one calendar, not as multiple calendars.**  
Calendar provides one place to view time‑bound commitments even when they originate from different groups or channels.
With Outlook synchronization, Outlook events can also appear in the same calendar view, reducing missed overlaps and double booking.

**Stay aligned when change is continuous.**  
Notifications provide a practical signal of what changed and what needs attention.
This reduces status‑checking cycles that exist only to collect updates.

**Use repeatable views for repeatable questions.**  
Tiles represent the questions that appear again and again, such as what needs attention, what is overdue, or what is waiting.
Instead of recreating filters and navigation paths, the view is saved and remains accessible.

## Why @@name

My Apps exists inside @@name, which means it operates on the same platform rules and the same business context as the rest of the system.
This matters because the workspace remains explainable and consistent as users, roles, and processes grow.

The apps are integrated at the data and process level, not through synchronization between separate tools.
Access rights and context stay consistent, so users see and act on the same reality rather than on copies.
This gives the organization a personal workspace that supports daily work without breaking the integrity of the business system.
