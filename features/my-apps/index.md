# My Apps in @@name

## Overview

Nowadays everyone comes across an immense variety of activities throughout their workday.  

Based on the role we take in our company, we do so much:  

* **Operative Activities** - engaging with tasks, entering and finding information, preparing documentation  
* **Creative Work** - idea generation, brainstorming, project management, authoring content and shaping product design  
* **Communication** - emails, phone talks, in-person and remote meetings, conducting interviews  
* **Organization** - managing events, scheduling meetings, ordering supplies  
* **Expert Work** - managing teams and their assignments, extracting useful insights, making informed decisions  

To support them throughout all these and other challenges and tasks, businesses and their teams look for apps dedicated for each of these purposes.
