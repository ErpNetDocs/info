# Team Collaboration and Social Groups

## Overview

[![ERP-net-Team-Collaboration-Video](https://github.com/k1kolev/info/assets/106669250/81a03116-18cf-45d3-81cb-878d2ed647c5)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZqUHhEe_NA&list=PL-2yF7gWGeLH0l9ODfgAK_mHrgP2rOVsT&index=7)

Automation and technology continue to lift a lot of manual labor off people.  
Human activities are increasingly shifting to expert work, coordination, and decision-making.  
In practice, that makes teamwork, communication, and information handling part of the real “production line” of modern companies.  

Team Collaboration in @@name is built around Social Groups.  
A Social Group is a shared team space where chat, calendar, To Dos, files, Cases, and video meetings live together inside the ERP system.  
This is the key advantage.  
When collaboration is embedded in @@name, teams can connect conversations directly to projects, documents, and work items, and the context stays attached to the business record instead of being scattered across external tools.

## Why this matters

Many organizations already use chat tools, separate meeting tools, file-sharing platforms, and task apps.  
The challenge usually appears in the gaps between them.  
Teams discuss a document in chat, schedule a meeting elsewhere, store files in a third system, and track follow-ups in a fourth.  
The work still happens, but context becomes fragile and handovers become harder to explain later.  

Social Groups solve this by keeping the collaboration toolbox inside @@name.  
This makes it easier to preserve context and traceability, because discussions, meeting outcomes, shared files, and team tasks can stay connected to the projects and records they belong to.  
It also supports remote and hybrid work in a natural way, because teams can coordinate and execute work in one shared environment regardless of where people are located.

## Key capabilities

**A digital workspace that matches real teams.**  
Social Groups allow you to represent departments, project teams, cross-functional workstreams, or small working circles inside @@name.  
This helps coordination follow the real organization structure, not an abstract tool structure.  

**Chatter for continuous discussion, with durable context.**  
Groups include a chat stream with replies and reactions.  
The value is not “more messages”.  
The value is that discussions stay available next to the work context and can be revisited when decisions need to be explained.  

**Shared Calendar for team coordination.**  
Groups include a shared calendar for meetings, calls, and other events relevant to the group.  
When a user is added as a participant to a group event, that event can also appear in their personal calendar view.  
This keeps team planning aligned with individual time commitments.  

> [!TIP]
> Calendar events and files belonging to a social group are visible inside it for every member of that group. 
> People who are added as participants in group calendar events also see those in their personal calendars.

**To Do for lightweight, group-based follow-ups.**  
Groups include a To Do tab for quick tasks and reminders that belong to the team context.  
When a To Do is assigned to a user, it is also visible in the user’s personal To Do list, so commitments do not disappear when the user switches away from the group.  

**Files shared where the team works.**  
Groups include a files area for sharing materials relevant to the team.  
This reduces the common pattern of “the file exists, but it is somewhere else”.  
It also keeps shared files close to the discussions and follow-ups they support.  

**Cases tab that connects collaboration to execution.**  
Groups include a Cases tab that lists the Cases linked to the group.  
A Case can be created from a group, so the work item starts with the correct collaboration context from day one.  
The result is that “what we discuss” and “what we do” can stay connected in the same workspace.  

**From Case to group collaboration, not only from group to Case.**  
The relationship also works in the opposite direction.  
When a Case needs broader coordination, a working group can be created for that Case, and the group can then be used for discussion, meetings, video calls, files, and follow-ups around the same Case context.  

**Video Meetings built into the group, with optional recording.**  
Groups include a Video Meetings tab so teams can meet in the same place where they chat, share files, and track follow-ups.  
When needed, a video meeting can be recorded and stored, so the outcome remains available for later review and onboarding.  

**Membership and access control.**  
Groups include member administration and access control, so collaboration can be open where it should be open and restricted where it must be restricted.  
This keeps team spaces usable without turning them into uncontrolled “all-company channels”.  

**Onboarding by membership, not by forwarding links.**  
Adding a new member to a group instantly shares the group space and its information with them.  
This helps onboarding because the new colleague can review the existing context, discussions, files, events, and follow-ups in one place. 

> [!TIP]
> Adding a new team member into a group instantly shares all the group's information with them. 
> This enables your company to **simplify and accelerate the onboarding** of new team members and help them become well-adept of their role.

## How it works (high level)

A Social Group acts as a container for collaboration.  
Instead of separating communication, meetings, tasks, and files into different tools, @@name provides them as tabs inside the same group space.  

Because the group exists inside the system, collaboration can stay connected to business context.  
Teams can link work to projects and Cases, and they can keep follow-ups and meeting outcomes close to the objects they affect.  
This reduces duplicated coordination work, because the context does not need to be reconstructed each time someone joins, takes over, or reviews what happened.

## Typical scenarios / use cases

**Project delivery with a stable shared space.**  
A project team uses one Social Group for continuous discussion, team meetings, shared materials, and quick follow-ups.  
Cases created from the group remain linked to it, so execution stays visible in the same team context.  

**Operations or support coordination.**  
A team uses the group to discuss incoming issues, assign small follow-ups as To Dos, and track execution through linked Cases.  
This keeps triage and execution connected, instead of splitting them across chat, task tools, and separate work queues.  

**A Case that turns into a cross-team topic.**  
A single Case requires coordination across roles.  
A group is created from the Case, and the team uses that group for discussion, video meetings, files, and follow-ups until the Case is resolved.  

**Remote and hybrid work without losing context.**  
Some colleagues work from home, others from the office, others while traveling.  
The group remains the shared place where meetings, decisions, files, and follow-ups stay available and connected to the same work context.

## Why @@name

Team Collaboration in @@name is embedded in the ERP system, not attached as an external tool that needs synchronization.  
This matters because collaboration can be linked directly to projects, Cases, and business records, and the context remains consistent over time.  

Access rights and membership rules are part of the same platform logic, so visibility stays controlled and predictable as teams grow and change.  
Recorded meetings, shared files, and discussion history remain connected to the same workspace where execution happens, which makes coordination more explainable later.
