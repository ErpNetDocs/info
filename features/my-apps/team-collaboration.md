Groups enable you to virtually represent your company's **actual teams and their work** within @@name's environment. 
Social Groups help your organization **grow**, **connect**, and **streamline** work and information flows in three major aspects:  

1. Create a common digital workspace for people to connect, share, and accomplish. 
2. Retain the focus on the role of the specific team to avoid unwanted distractions while working. 
3. Combine all the necessary information and activities, streamed in a single, well-known place. 

Groups help in defining teams in order to easily **match the job to the right people**, organized by department, project, or designation. 
This helps managers **assess** the numerous chunks of work, **structure** them into assignments, and **distribute** them throughout the relevant teams.  

> [!TIP]
> Adding a new team member into a group instantly shares all the group's information with them. 
> This enables your company to **simplify and accelerate the onboarding** of new team members and help them become well-adept of their role.  

Social Groups include various integrated features:  

* **Chatter** - instant communication with replies and reactions similar to common social media networks 
* **Shared Calendar** - for sharing events, such as organized meetings, calls, time off, and others 
* **To Do** - reminders about pending work with due dates, reminder times, notes, status, and others 
* **Group Files** - a place for sharing files of common interest to the selected group members 
* **Group Members** - options for listing and administration of the selected group members 

Groups place you in the center of action, letting you know about all current tasks and events the moment they are planned. 
Team collaboration of @@name helps you never miss out on important details and events.  

> [!TIP]
> Calendar events and files belonging to a social group are visible inside it for every member of that group. 
> People who are added as participants in group calendar events also see those in their personal calendars.

## Team collaboration in modern business

Increasing competition, rising customer expectations, and uncertain economic environments can all challenge a company. 
Meeting these requirements calls for companies to look for ways to combine individual efforts and streamline them into collaboration practices.  

Manually unifying the invidiual efforts of team members often consumes valuable time and resources. 
**@@name's Team collaboration** module transfers this job from people to your system, letting you and your teams engage in more useful activities.  

Many businesses now rely on **remote** and **hybrid work models** to obtain flexibility, attract more professionals, and expand their coverage. 
**@@name's Social Groups** can help you in fostering a culture of **social belonging** and **team participation**.  

Positive work culture and well-working teams give people in your company a **sense of connection and purpose**. 
Such qualities can naturally boost overall performance.
