## Overview

Information nowadays is everywhere we turn and look. 
And thankfully so, since **deep and detailed information is absolutely imperative** for achieving a great performance with our numerous assignments. 
Hence, it is one of the **highest-in-value resources** we have at our disposal.  

Growing information can quite overwhelm us, though. 
So many companies, customers, partners, and teams around us means we are constantly operating with more and more data.  

Storing this information in a **unified, understandable way** in a **single, secure place** is one thing. 
Finding **strictly what we need** - **now**, **fast** - is another.  

And the more fast-paced our business environment is, the more the importance of **quick and suitable access to data** increases. 
Having to navigate back and forth to the same types of data time and again, especially under pressure, can be challenging.  

And this is a challenge that **@@name** enables you to instantly tackle with its built-in application **Tiles**.  

## Your Data on Focus

**@@name's Tiles** application enables your teams to **preview and access information** about interesting groups of records **neatly organized in tiles**. 
Each tile shows a **caption** and the **number of records that will be presented** when you select it.

## Let @@name do the navigation for you

Enhancing navigation, **tiles** also **act as shortcuts** to their **related groups of records**.  

When set without any filters, **tiles** can bring up **tables of records** that you find **more important** or **frequently visit**. 
Your system **does all the navigation for you** in a split second.  

## Leave the heavy lifting to Tiles

**Tiles** are able to do more than just lead to places of interest - they can **display specific records** that are intended to **grab your attention**.

## A powerful ally in your everyday business

**@@name's Tiles** app natively embraces **user-friendliness** for **ease of use**.  

**Tiles** can be **shown at various locations** in the platform, wherever your business deems them fit:  

* **Show them on your dashboard** to make them visible at first glance  
* **Review them in the dedicated Tiles panel** of @@name's My Apps collection  
* **Display them within any panel, record, or next to any table of records (navigator)** to implement them in context  
* **Display several tile panels in the same location**, each showing a different group of tiles aligning with your needs  

> [!TIP]  
> You can give each tile a **suitable name** to let your teams **know in advance what to expect** when **viewing and selecting them**.  

### Get exactly what you need at your fingertips

The variety of situations we find ourselves in our highly dynamic business landscape demands us to **stay flexible and adaptive**.  

Oftentimes, you and your team members find yourselves **constantly using the same table of records**. 
But with each of your tasks, you are interested in a **distinct subset of those records** differing from the rest **in some properties**.  

For example, a lot of your day may be spent **reviewing the available quantities** of your products. 
However, **each specific inquiry** or **order** of a customer has you looking at the **availability of distinct items** in your **store** or **warehouse**.  

The **Tiles** app helps your business **accelerate information retrieval** in such situations. 
**@@name** provides you the opportunity to create **as many tiles for the same table of records as desired**, varying in **filter criteria**. 
All of them will **lead to the same table** but will **show different contents within**.  

### Versatile by nature and adaptive by business

Just as with all the apps in **@@name**, versatility is a native trait of the **Tiles** app.  

**Tiles adapt to the location** they are visualized in when **using them as a widget**.  

The **widget Tiles panel** in your **@@name platform** is dependent on the context of the specific location where it is displayed. 
The system **automatically determines the tiles relevant to this location** and makes them **available for display**:

> [!TIP]
> You can select **various tiles having different filter combination** in the same location with a single tap. 
> This makes the app capable of **switching between different subsets of records** directly within the **context of your work and your actions**.  

## Collaboration is the new norm in business

To **empower your team collaboration** and **firmly establish consistent work manners**, **tiles** are **role-oriented**. 
Each tile is saved in relation to a **specific role**.  

Your company can enjoy the boost in collaboration in several directions:  

* **Strong Teamwork**: Everyone using a given role is guaranteed to see and use exactly the same collection of tiles on their dashboard and in their personal app  
* **Focus and Guidance**: The role your users select automatically brings them a collection of tiles with it, indicating the important or frequently visited tables of records  
* **Consistency**: People sharing the same role will immediately come across any changes applied to tiles, helping everyone stay up to date with the latest organization of your work
