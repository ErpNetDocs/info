# Tiles Application

## Overview

Information nowadays is everywhere we turn and look. 
And thankfully so, since deep and detailed information is absolutely imperative for performing great with our numerous assignments. 
Hence, it is one of the highest-in-value resources we have at our disposal.  

Growing information can quite overwhelm us, though. 
So many companies, customers, partners, and teams around us means we are constantly operating with more and more data.  

Storing this information in a unified, understandable way in a single, secure place is one thing. 
Finding strictly what we need - now, fast - is another.  

And the more fast-paced our business environment is, the more the importance of quick and suitable access to data becomes. 
Having to navigate back and forth to the same types of data time and again, especially under pressure, can be challenging.  

And this is a challenge that @@name enables you to instantly tackle with its built-in application **Tiles**.  

## Your Data on Focus

Rapidly occurring tasks, speaking with customers and partners, and responding to questions and inquiries all share something in common - the necessity to find what you are looking for and understand it with speed and confidence.  

@@name's Tiles application enables your teams to preview and access information about interesting groups of records neatly organized in tiles. 
Each tile shows a caption and the number of records that will be presented to you when you select it.

When set without any filters, tiles can bring up tables of records that you find more important or frequently visit. 
Your system does all the navigation for you in a split second.  

## Leave the heavy lifting to Tiles

Tiles are able to do more than just lead to places of interest - they can display specific records that are intended to grab your attention.

Predefined filtering makes them capable of bringing up only the records matching your requirements:

### Get exactly what you need at your fingertips

In our high-dynamic business landscape, many scenarios demand us to stay flexible and adaptive. 
Oftentimes, you and your team members find yourselves constantly using the same table of records. 
But with each of your tasks, you are interested in a distinct subset of those records differing from the rest in some properties.  

For example, a lot of your day may be spent reviewing the available quantities of your products. 
However, each specific inquiry or order of a customer has you looking at the availability of distinct items in your store or warehouse.  

The Tiles app helps your business flourish in such situations. 
@@name provides you the opportunity to create as many tiles for the same table of records as desired, varying in filter criteria. 
All of them will lead to the same table but will show different contents within.  

### Versatile by nature and adaptive by business

Just as with all the apps in @@name, versatility is a native trait of the Tiles app. 
Tiles adapt to the location they are visualized in, also known in @@name platform as a widget.  

Using the tile panel in a specific location in your @@name platform is context-driven. 
The app automatically selects only the tiles that are relevant to this location and makes them available for display:

> [!TIP]
> The unique functionality allows you to easily switch between full filter combinations for the same location in a single tap.
> This makes the app capable of catering to your needs directly within the context of your work and your actions. 

## Collaboration is the new norm in business

To empower your team collaboration and firmly establish consistent work manners, tiles are role-oriented. 
Each tile is connected to a specific role.  

Strengthen your collaboration, your company can enjoy:  

* **Strong Teamwork**: Everyone using a given role is guaranteed to see and use exactly the same collection of tiles on their dashboard and in their personal app  
* **Focus and Guidance**: The role your users select automatically brings them a collection of tiles with it, indicating the important or frequently visited tables of records  
* **Consistency**: People sharing the same role will immediately come across any changes applied to tiles, helping everyone stay up to date with the latest organization of your work
