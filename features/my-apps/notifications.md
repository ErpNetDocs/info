# Notifications in ERP.net

## Value proposition

Notifications in ERP.net keep you informed about changes that require attention, without turning the day into constant checking.
They are designed to stay connected to the business object behind the event, so a notification is not just a message, but an entry point to the actual context.

A key advantage is that notifications are grouped by object.
You can see what is new around a specific document, Case, or conversation thread as one coherent stream, instead of receiving an endless series of disconnected messages.

## Why this matters

In real work, important events do not arrive “one by one” in a clean order.  
The same object can generate multiple signals in a short time: a comment, a mention, an assignment, an update, a reminder.  
If each event becomes a separate alert, attention turns into noise, and noise turns into avoidance.

Grouping notifications by object changes that dynamic.  
You still get notified, but you can process updates in context.  
You can see what happened “around this object”, decide whether you need to act, and only then open the chronological trail when you want the details.

## Key capabilities

**Notifications grouped by the object they relate to.**  
When an event is related to a specific object, ERP.net keeps the notification tied to that object.  
This allows the Notifications view to consolidate what is new about the same item, so you can stay informed without being flooded by older or repetitive events.

**A controllable read flow.**  
Notifications have a read state.  
Users can focus on unread items or review the full list when needed, and they can mark notifications as read as part of their daily “inbox zero” routine.

**Direct action from the notification, while the context is still fresh.**  
A notification can serve as a direct entry point to the related object, so you can open what changed instead of searching for it.  
When a notification represents work to be done, ERP.net also supports creating a To Do directly from the notification context, including an AI-assisted option for drafting the task from the notification content.

**Noise control through notification classes and settings.**  
Notifications are organized by classes, and users can choose which classes they want to receive.  
Notification settings can also define whether a class is delivered in-app, by email, or by SMS, so “important” and “informational” events do not compete for the same channel.

## How it works (high level)

ERP.net creates notifications as a result of real business events.  
A notification can be related to a specific data object, such as a document, a Case, or another record.  
This object relationship is what enables object-based grouping and “open the context” navigation.

Users typically process notifications in two layers.  
First, they review the grouped overview to see which objects changed and which ones need attention now.  
Second, when needed, they open the object-specific stream to see the events in order and act with full context.

## Typical scenarios / use cases

**Many updates around one object, but one place to look.**  
A sales document receives several updates during the day: a comment, a state change, a mention, and an assignment.  
Instead of treating these as four separate interruptions, the Notifications view groups them under the same object, so the user can process them together.

**Operational work that turns into a follow-up task.**  
A user receives a notification about a comment that includes a clear request.  
From the notification context, they create a To Do so the request becomes an explicit commitment, not a message that will be forgotten.

**Staying informed without over-notifying.**  
A manager wants to receive only the classes that signal responsibility or decisions, and keep the rest as in-app only.  
Notification classes and settings allow this separation, so focus is preserved without losing traceability.

## Why ERP.net

Notifications in ERP.net are part of the platform, not an external add-on.  
They can be raised by different apps across the system and remain connected to the same business objects and access rules.

This is what makes grouping by object practical and reliable.  
The notification is tied to the same “source of truth” record that teams work with, so context is not reconstructed from separate tools.  
When users adjust notification settings by class and channel, the result is a predictable signal model that remains stable as teams and processes grow.
