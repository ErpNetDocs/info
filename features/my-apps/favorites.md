At your workplace, you receive a lot of information from multiple sources. 
You participate in meetings and a variety of projects, deal with customers, support colleagues when they need, prepare campaigns, etc.  

Over time you become overwhelmed by a great deal of data, and it is challenging to navigate quickly through an ocean of information and to find easily what you are searching for. 
Here comes the Favorites app designed to improve your experience within the ERP.net system.  

## Improve your performance step-by-step with the ERP.net Favorites app

The Favorites app enables you to personalize your workflow within the ERP platform. You can arrange/organize for example:  

* Items you find interesting
* Meetings
* Tasks that require immediate attention (high-priority tasks)
* Reports
* Frequently performed actions

so, you can focus on the most important items and improve your decisionâ€“making process.  

When you open the My Favorites page you will see all records you have marked as shortcuts with the name of the object of interest.  

In the Favorites app page, each item is automatically assigned to a group of objects depending on which navigator it belongs to, for example, Campaigns, Customers, Target groups, Offers, etc. 
With one click on the shortcut, the system sends you to the page with the corresponding record of the object. Thus, you save time from navigating the platform, reaching detailed information about the item.  

## Quick and easy access to favorite items

With the never-ending workflow and your expanding list of daily duties, you need to find records in the resource planning platform as easily as possible. 
ERP.net Favorites app enables you to do that with minimum effort. 
When you add an object to the Favorites app, it is not confined only to the Favorites page. 
You can use the application as a **widget** too, displayed in a specific context of a record form, navigator, or module. 
ERP.net system automatically visualizes the item as a shortcut in the panel of the particular place.  

> [!Tip]  
> Favorite objects are not limited to the application page in the ERP.net system. 
> The system refines them according to the context of the place you are in.
