By today's standards, **easy access to important information is key**. Yet, we are still often faced with what can best be described as the consequences of **data fragmentation**. 

In any business, information flows in constantly and tends to pile up over time. Professionals in many fields often have to sift through **vast amounts of data** located across **multiple systems and applications** just to find "that one" crucial record or document. 

Whether it's retrieving a customer profile, product details, or an ongoing project, the process can be **time-consuming** and **prone to errors**. Over time, this can gradually **impact productivity**, particularly when you need to find specific information quickly and in context.

What businesses seek now is a way to **prioritize, organize** and **retrieve** data and tasks that truly matter to them - when it matters the most. This "shortcut" to what is essential can not only **save time** but also **improve the quality of decision-making**, keeping teams focused on high-value activities.

This is why **ERP.net** offers a solution that helps you **streamline** the access to your most important resources, allowing you to remain agile and effective in a fast-paced business environment.

## Implementation of Favorites in ERP.net

The **Favorites app** is a central hub for records that you deem valuable. It works like a placeholder for shortcuts that **only you** can access.

**Favorites** supports a variety of **categories**, allowing you to store records such as **customer and competitor profiles**, **marketing campaigns**, **documents**, and even **tasks** for easy reference. 

Adding and removing items from your **Favorites** list both take approximately **one mouse-click** to be achieved.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Favorites** is not fully manual. <br>
> If you are **tagged** in a chat for any document, the latter will be **automatically** added to your Favorites.

Despite all of these benefits, even a favorite can **change** over time. 

If any of your items receives an update on its details by someone from your organization, you will be **notified about it in the app itself**. The number of updates is **conveniently displayed** on the item and **tracked in real-time**.

## Opportunities and integrations

Any single instances of documents or tasks can be added as favorites. **But what if you wanted to include an entire group**? 

Many business processes involve a series of interrelated documents - for example, quotes leading to sales orders, which may arise from earlier opportunities. The **Favorites app** links these documents together and displays the one they originated from. 

Furthermore, **Favorites is not constrained within a single space**. 

Thanks to ERP.net's internal connectivity with other [My apps](index.md), **you have the option to "import" your favorite items** directly onto your [Dashboard](dashboard.md) and almost any navigator and document form. 

## Utilizing ERP.net's Favorites app

With **Favorites**, time spent on searching and retrieving records stays in the past. This allows you to not only **easily access prioritized records** but also **dynamically customize your Favorites environment** whenever you decide you no longer need them.

The app features the following capabilities:

- **Centralized view** - all of your important records are conveniently displayed in one place for quick access.
  
- **Category grouping** - related favorite items are automatically grouped together under a common category.

- **One-click access** - reaching a desired favorite item is as easy as it gets.

- **Simplified management** - you can add and remove favorite items outside of the app with the help of a single button.

- **Notifications** - updates to your favorite items are displayed at their top-right corners.

- **Customizable interface** - favorite elements can be removed directly from the app itself.

- **Seamless integration** - Favorites can be integrated as a widget into the ERP.net [Dashboard](dashboard.md) and navigators.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Favorites** is available in all subscription plans of ERP.net. <br>
> The app remains always available to your business regardless of the plan you initially choose or later switch to.

## Conclusion

In business, staying organized and having quick access to the right information at the right time is essential. 

**Favorites** brings together the most important elements of your personal workflow, making them **readily available within a customizable centralized view**. It decreases time spent on searching and instead prioritizes focusing on what matters.
