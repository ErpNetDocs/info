# Cases  
## Where tasks turn into real work

At the core of every project activity are concrete tasks.  
They define what needs to be done, by whom, within what timeframe, and in what context.

The clearer these tasks are defined and managed, the more predictable the work becomes — both for teams and for management.  
That is why task management is not an operational detail, but a key element of project management as a whole.

Many organizations sense this intuitively — work gets done, but context, decisions, and progress are often managed across multiple tools.

## The core instrument: Cases in Project Management in @@name

In Project Management in @@name, work execution is organized through **Cases**.  
They are the place where tasks are planned, taken on, executed, and tracked — without losing context along the way.

Each Case brings together everything needed for real work:  
who is responsible, what the priority is, what the current status is, what has been discussed, which documents are involved, and how the process has evolved over time.

This transforms a Case from a simple task into a complete unit of work — one that can be managed, analyzed, and extended.

The way Cases are designed allows teams to start with minimal information when needs are simple, and gradually add structure, detail, and control as projects grow more complex and requirements increase.  
As a result, Cases remain comfortable for everyday operational work while being fully suitable for large-scale projects with extensive coordination and business-level accountability.

## What a Case represents in @@name

A Case in @@name is not just a task to be checked off.  
It is a focal point of work — the place where an intention becomes real execution.

A Case can start and finish very simply — with just a name and an owner.  
Exactly as much as is needed to move work forward.

As work evolves, the Case can naturally grow with it.  
Priority, deadlines, statuses, descriptions, notes, and links to other tasks can be added — only when the business process requires it.

A Case brings together in one place:

- responsibility and deadlines  
- current state and full history  
- internal discussions and comments directly related to the work  
- files and documents used in the process  

This way, a task is never “bare” — it always carries its context.

## A workspace, not just a record

A Case in @@name is designed as a workspace, not a static object.

Within a Case, users can:

- track time directly while working  
- define estimated time when planning is required  
- use Story Points when the team works that way  
- associate the Case with a Sprint when work is iterative  

A Case can also be linked:

- to a specific project  
- to a Social Group when the task concerns a particular team  
- to a Party (customer, partner, or counterparty), independently of who the task is assigned to  

This allows tasks to be viewed not only as “who does what”, but also **for whom** and **in what business context**.

---

## Control over time and state — when it is needed

Cases support different time-related states, such as readiness, waiting, or completion moments.  
These markers make it possible to analyze how work actually flows, without adding burden to daily operations.

By default, tasks move through standard states such as **Backlog**, **In Progress**, **Waiting**, or **Closed**.  
When a business follows a more specific process, these states can be extended and adapted through custom **User States**.

The system does not impose a model — it follows it.

---

## Simplicity on the surface, depth underneath

The most important aspect of Cases is that no one is required to use everything at once.  
Teams can work in a light and intuitive way, while the system remains ready to support more structure, control, and accountability whenever needed.

This combination — ease of use with real depth — makes Cases suitable both for everyday tasks and for complex project environments.

---

## Context and communication — part of the task itself

One of the greatest strengths of Cases is that all communication can take place directly within the task.

Discussions, decisions, and clarifications do not get lost in emails or chats — they remain part of the Case history.  
This provides clear answers to questions such as:

- why a certain decision was made  
- what was discussed  
- who was involved  

Context stays with the work — even as people or priorities change.

---

## Hierarchy and focus in execution

Cases allow tasks to be managed hierarchically.

A Case can contain subcases, making it possible to:

- break down larger activities into logical steps  
- clearly distribute responsibilities  
- preserve the connection between overall goals and concrete actions  

This is especially valuable in more complex projects and cross-team coordination.

## When work has a clear entry point and a clear flow — Backlog and Kanban

In real work, tasks do not arrive neatly ordered.  
Ideas, requests, improvement proposals, issues, and commitments constantly emerge — from customers, teams, and management.

That is why in Project Management in @@name, **Cases begin their life in the Backlog** — the place where all upcoming work is collected, organized, and prioritized.  
The Backlog answers the question *“What’s next?”* without creating pressure or a sense of overload.

How this work is planned and organized is entirely in the hands of the teams.  
Users decide which Cases from the Backlog are ready to be taken on, when, and with what priority — turning planning into an active process rather than a static list.

From there, **Kanban visualization turns planning into action**.  
With an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, Cases move between statuses — from idea, through preparation and execution, to completion — directly from the visual view.

This allows teams to see at a glance:

- what is currently in progress  
- which Cases are waiting for input or decisions  
- which Cases are planned  
- which Cases are completed  

Kanban in @@name is more than visualization.  
It is a tool for focus, balance, and consistency — a way for work to move forward without losing control over priorities.

The Backlog secures the **input** of work.  
Kanban manages its **flow**.  
And Cases are where all of this happens — in a clear business context.

## Business benefits: what the business gains from Cases

When tasks are managed through Cases in @@name, the business gains far more than an organized task list.

### Clear responsibility and traceability  
Every task has an owner, a history, and context — decisions and actions remain visible over time.

### Better coordination between teams  
People work in a shared space where communication, files, and progress are transparent to all involved.

### Less operational friction  
Documents, discussions, and time tracking happen where work is done — without unnecessary switching between tools.

### Predictable and controllable execution  
Progress is visible, delays are detected early, and management decisions are based on real information.

## Applicability: where Cases work best

Cases are especially valuable where work is not one-off, but evolves over time and involves people, decisions, and context.

### Client and project work  
When multiple tasks are performed for a client or project, each Case can represent a specific activity — with owner, deadline, discussion, and documents.  
This keeps the full history of work traceable: what was requested, agreed upon, and delivered.

### Internal initiatives and improvements  
Cases bring the same clarity to internal work as to client projects.  
Ideas and improvements do not get lost — they become concrete tasks with visible progress.

### Operational coordination across teams  
When multiple roles or departments are involved, the Case becomes a shared point of work.  
Everyone sees the current state, participates in discussion, and works with the same information.

### Services and time-accountable activities  
Cases are a natural choice when it is important to know how much time was spent, on which task, and for what outcome.  
Time tracking directly from the Case makes the connection between effort and results fully transparent.
