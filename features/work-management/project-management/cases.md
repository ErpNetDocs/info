# Cases  

## Where tasks turn into real work

At the core of every project are concrete tasks.  
They define what needs to be done, by whom, within what timeframe, and in what context.  
When tasks are defined and managed consistently, teams spend less time clarifying ownership and current status.  
Management can evaluate workload and progress based on what is actually recorded, rather than on ad‑hoc updates.

Many organizations feel this challenge intuitively.  
Work gets done, but context, decisions, and progress end up distributed across multiple tools.  
Later, it becomes surprisingly hard to answer simple questions like why a decision was made, what changed, and who agreed on what.

## The core instrument: Cases in Project Management in @@name

In Project Management in @@name, work execution is organized through **Cases**.  
A Case is where a task is planned, taken on, executed, and tracked, while keeping the relevant context attached to the work.

A Case brings together what a team typically needs to execute responsibly.  
It keeps ownership, priority, current state, discussion, related documents and files, and the history of changes over time in one place.  
This turns a Case into a practical unit of work that the team can coordinate around and the organization can review later with clarity.

Cases are usable from day one.  
A team can start with only what is necessary, such as a title and an owner.  
As requirements grow, the Case can grow with them by adding deadlines, user states, estimates, links to related work, or additional detail when the process actually needs it.  
This keeps Cases comfortable for everyday operational tasks, while still supporting complex project environments where traceability and accountability matter.

## What a Case represents in @@name

A Case in @@name is not just a checkbox in a list.  
It is the point where an intention becomes execution, with a defined owner and a visible state.

A Case can be lightweight when the work is simple.  
It can start with just a name and an owner, exactly as much as is needed to begin.  
As the work evolves, priority, deadlines, statuses, notes, dependencies, and related work can be added when the business process requires them.

Most importantly, a Case is never bare.  
Ownership and deadlines sit next to the current state and the full history.  
Discussions, decisions, and clarifications remain attached to the work, instead of being lost in email threads or chat logs.  
Files and documents used during execution stay easy to find later, in the same place where the task lives.

## A workspace, not just a record

A Case in @@name is designed as a workspace for execution, not a static object stored somewhere for reference.

Within a Case, users can track time while working.  
They can define estimated time when planning is required.  
They can use Story Points when the team prefers that approach.  
When work is iterative, a Case can also be associated with a Sprint.

Cases can be linked to the relevant business and organizational context as well.  
A Case can be connected to a specific project.  
It can be associated with a Social Group when the work concerns a particular team.  
It can be linked to a Party, such as a customer, partner, or counterparty, independently of who the Case is assigned to.  
This helps teams see work not only as who does what, but also for whom and in what business context.

*A Case in @@name keeps execution, context, files, communication, and time in one place — so the work remains explainable later.*

## Control over time and state — when it is needed

Cases support time-related markers such as readiness, waiting, or completion moments.  
These markers make flow visible.  
They help teams and managers see where work moves smoothly, where it waits, and where delays accumulate, without turning daily execution into a heavy reporting exercise.

By default, Cases move through standard states such as Backlog, In Progress, Waiting, or Closed.  
When a business follows a more specific workflow, states can be extended and adapted through custom **User States**.  
The goal is not to impose a methodology.  
The goal is to make the team’s real process explicit and shared, so it remains understandable even as more people join the work.

## Simplicity on the surface, depth underneath

Cases do not require heavy setup to be useful.  
Teams can work with the minimum they need today, and add structure only when the process demands it tomorrow.  
This keeps the same Case model usable for quick operational execution and for larger-scale coordination with reviewable history.

---

## Context and communication — part of the task itself

Cases keep communication where it matters: inside the task.  
When a Case is revisited weeks or months later, the discussion and decisions are still there, next to the files and the state history.  
That continuity reduces rework, because the team does not need to reconstruct context from memory.

---

## Hierarchy and focus in execution

Cases support hierarchical execution through subcases.  
This allows teams to break down larger activities into logical steps.  
It also helps distribute responsibilities clearly while preserving the relationship between an overall goal and the concrete actions required to achieve it.

For cross-team projects, hierarchy protects focus.  
Teams can coordinate on smaller, owned parts of the work without losing their connection to the bigger outcome.

## When work has a clear entry point and a clear flow — Backlog and Kanban

In real organizations, tasks do not arrive neatly ordered.  
Requests, incidents, improvements, and commitments appear continuously from customers, teams, and management.  
That is why in Project Management in @@name, Cases typically begin in the **Backlog**.  
The Backlog is where upcoming work is collected, organized, and prioritized.  
It answers the practical question “What’s next?” without forcing immediate execution or creating artificial urgency.

Planning remains a team responsibility.  
Teams decide which Cases from the Backlog are ready to be taken on, when, and with what priority.  
From there, **Kanban** visualization helps turn planning into execution by making flow visible across states, from idea and preparation, through work in progress, to completion.

This visibility helps teams and managers see what is in progress, what is waiting for input or decisions, what is planned next, and what is completed.  
In this sense, Kanban in @@name is not only a visual view.  
It is a way to keep work-in-progress and waiting time observable, so priorities and capacity can be managed with fewer assumptions.

The Backlog secures the intake of work.  
Kanban helps manage its flow.  
Cases are where execution, context, and history stay together in a clear business context.

## Why ERP.net

Cases in @@name are built on a platform that emphasizes explicit models, enforceable rules, and traceable processes.

This translates into practical, checkable outcomes.  
Work remains **explainable** because a Case keeps state, history, discussion, and files together, so the current situation can be understood from what is recorded.  
Processes remain **predictable** because teams can make workflow explicit through states and rules, rather than relying on informal habits.  
Because @@name uses **consistent concepts across the platform**, Cases can stay connected to projects, teams, and business parties without losing meaning as the organization grows.

## Business benefits: what the business gains from Cases

When tasks are managed through Cases in @@name, the business gains more than an organized list.  
It gains a work record that remains readable over time.

**Clear responsibility and traceability.**  
Ownership is explicit, state is visible, and changes remain reviewable through the Case history.

**Better coordination between teams.**  
Communication, files, and progress stay attached to the same work item, reducing misunderstandings and duplicate effort.

**Less operational friction.**  
Time tracking, documents, and discussions happen where the work happens, minimizing tool-switching and context loss.

**Predictable and controllable execution.**  
Progress and waiting states are visible, delays can be detected earlier, and decisions can be based on recorded reality rather than informal status summaries.

## Applicability: where Cases work best

Cases are especially valuable where work evolves over time and involves people, decisions, and context, not just a one-off action.

**Client and project work.**  
Requests, agreements, delivery files, and decisions remain attached to the Case, making the full path from request to outcome traceable.

**Internal initiatives and improvements.**  
Ideas do not get lost.  
They become Cases with ownership and visible state, so progress can be reviewed without reconstructing history from meetings and messages.

**Operational coordination across teams.**  
When several roles or departments are involved, the Case becomes the shared point of work.  
Everyone sees the same state, participates in the same discussion, and works with the same context.

**Services and time-accountable activities.**  
When it matters how much time was spent, on which task, and for what outcome, time tracking directly from the Case keeps effort and results connected and reviewable.
