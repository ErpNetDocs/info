# Project Types, Case Categories & WIP Limits

## When work needs focus and flow

As teams and projects grow, work naturally expands.  
More tasks appear. More requests. More parallel activities.

At a certain point, however, it becomes clear that cases alone are not enough.  
The real challenge is no longer how much work is being done, but:

- which work makes sense to take on right now  
- how it is ordered and prioritized  
- how it moves through the team without overload and bottlenecks  

This is where project management shifts from tracking work to managing **flow, capacity, and focus**.

In @@name, this is achieved through **Project Types, Case Categories, and WIP limits** — tools that help work stay structured, understandable, and realistically planned *before execution even begins*.

## Project Types – when projects have different natures

Not all projects are the same.  
And businesses know this very well.

Some projects are client implementations.  
Others are internal improvements.  
Others still involve legal cases, product development, operational support, or research activities.

The differences go beyond subject matter.  
They affect how work is organized, what expectations exist, which stages are involved, how control is applied, and how progress is measured.

When all these different projects are managed in the same way, familiar problems appear:

- unnecessary fields and steps  
- lack of clarity about what really matters  
- processes that slow work down instead of supporting it  

That is why in Project Management in @@name, projects are not treated as generic objects.

They are defined through **Project Types** — the tool that allows each project type to have its own logic, structure, and rules, aligned with how work is actually done.

---

## Project Types – how the system understands what kind of project you are creating

Before a project is created, the system asks a simple but extremely important question:

**“What type of project is this?”**

In @@name, this choice is not a formality.  
It determines how the project will be structured, managed, and used in real work.

A Project Type describes the nature of the project — whether it is a client implementation, an internal initiative, product development, a legal case, operational work, or something specific to your business.

Based on the Project Type, the system knows:

- what information is relevant for this kind of project  
- which Case Categories are allowed  
- what working logic should apply  

This allows projects to adapt to real working practices, instead of people adapting to a universal template.

---

## Project Type vs. Project Group – similar concepts, different roles

This is where confusion often arises, so the distinction matters.

**Project Type** answers the question:  
*“What kind of project is this?”*  
It defines the identity of the project and how it works.

**Project Group** answers the question:  
*“Which projects belong to the same family and should share a common structure?”*  
It is used when multiple projects need the same Areas and Milestones, without making them global for everyone.

In short:

- **Project Type** defines *what the project is*  
- **Project Group** defines *shared structure across multiple projects*  

This combination allows project management to be both standardized and flexible.

**How to choose correctly:**

- If you want to define the nature of a project → **Project Type**  
- If you want multiple projects to share the same structure → **Project Group**

---

## Case Categories – how project type defines the way work is done

Once a project has its type, the next logical question is:

**“What kind of work happens inside this project?”**

This is where **Case Categories** come into play in @@name.

Case Categories define the types of tasks that can exist within a project and the working logic they carry.

While the Project Type defines *what the project is*,  
Case Categories define *what kind of work is performed inside it*.

---

## From structure to real work

In real life, different projects involve different types of activities:

- analysis  
- development  
- coordination  
- client communication  
- approvals  
- support  
- internal improvements  

Case Categories allow these activities to be clearly distinguished, instead of being mixed into a single list of tasks.

Each category can have its own logic, such as:

- different fields  
- different statuses  
- different tracking approaches  
- different working rules  

Tasks are no longer just “another Case”,  
but part of a clear working model aligned with the project type.

---

## How Project Types and Case Categories work together

This is where the connection to Project Types becomes critical.

Each Project Type can define:

- which Case Categories are allowed  
- what types of work make sense in this project  
- what the expected workflow should be  

For example:

- a **Client Implementation** project may include *Analysis, Configuration, Testing*  
- an **Internal Operations** project may include *Requests, Improvements, Incidents*  
- a **Legal / Advisory** project may include *Consultation, Drafting, Review*  

As a result:

- teams work with familiar and meaningful categories  
- projects have predictable structure  
- management gains comparability and clarity  

---

## Better project management, stronger focus

Case Categories do not complicate work — they **focus it**.

Instead of all tasks looking the same across all projects:

- teams know exactly what kind of work they are doing  
- managers see which types of work consume the most capacity  
- projects become easier to manage and analyze  

This naturally leads to the next step —  
controlling workload and work flow through **WIP limits**.

---

## WIP limits – when work flow has real boundaries

Once we define what types of work are being done through Case Categories, the next — and much harder — question appears:

**“How much work can we realistically handle at the same time?”**

In many organizations, this question remains unanswered.  
The result is familiar:

- too many tasks “in progress”  
- constant context switching  
- a feeling of being busy, but slow progress  

This is exactly where **WIP limits** come into play in Project Management in @@name.

---

## What WIP limits are

WIP (Work In Progress) limits define the maximum number of Cases that can be in a given status or category at the same time.

This is not a restriction on people.  
It is a restriction on the system — so it reflects the team’s real capacity.

In simple terms:

- when the limit is reached  
- new work does not automatically flow in  
- existing work must be completed first  

---

## Why this matters for management

WIP limits protect both teams and management from one of the most common traps in project work:

**assigning more work than can realistically be completed.**

With WIP limits:

- planning becomes realistic  
- workload becomes visible  
- decisions are based on capacity, not assumptions  

Managers no longer assign work blindly,  
but work with a clear signal of when the system is overloaded and when it can take on more.

---

## Flow, not a task list

WIP limits change how work is perceived.

The focus shifts:

- from *how many tasks we have*  
- to *how tasks move*  

Work starts to be seen as a flow, not as accumulation.

This leads to:

- shorter lead times  
- fewer blocked tasks  
- a more sustainable working rhythm  

---

## WIP limits as part of the bigger picture

In @@name, WIP limits do not exist in isolation.

They work together with:

- **Project Types** — defining project context  
- **Case Categories** — defining types of work  
- **User States** — showing movement and progress  

The system does not merely store a list of tasks.  
It actively supports balanced distribution of work.

---

## The real value

WIP limits are not a methodology.  
They are a **practical decision-making tool**.

They help:

- teams work on fewer things, but finish more  
- managers plan without overloading people  
- businesses achieve predictable outcomes  

Work does not slow down.  
It simply starts flowing better.

---

## Conclusion

Project Types, Case Categories, and WIP limits work together as a management filter between intention and execution.

They help businesses:

- define what type of work is being done  
- manage different work streams clearly and predictably  
- plan based on real capacity, not urgency or pressure  

The result is not more control, but **better focus**.

Teams understand what they are working on and why.  
Management sees where capacity goes and how work moves.

This transforms Project Management from a tracking tool into a system for better decisions.
