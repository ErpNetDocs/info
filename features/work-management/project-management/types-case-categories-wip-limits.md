# Project Types, Case Categories & WIP Limits

## When work needs focus and flow

As teams and projects grow, work naturally expands.  
More requests appear, more parallel activities start, and priorities change more often.  
At that stage, Cases remain the place where work happens, but teams also need a way to shape *what enters the system*, *how work is classified*, and *how much can run in parallel without overload*.

That is where project management shifts from tracking execution to managing flow, capacity, and focus.  
In @@name, this is supported through Project Types, Case Categories, and WIP limits.  
Together, they help work stay structured, understandable, and realistically planned before execution even begins.

## Project Types – when projects have different natures

Not all projects are the same, and organizations feel that difference daily.  
Some projects are client implementations, others are internal improvements, and others involve product development, operational support, advisory work, or research.

These differences are not only about subject matter.  
They change what information matters, which stages exist, what “done” means, and what controls make sense along the way.  
If every project follows the same template, familiar problems appear: irrelevant fields, unclear priorities, and workflows that slow work down instead of supporting it.

That is why Project Management in @@name does not treat projects as generic objects.  
Projects are defined through **Project Types**, so each type can follow a logic that matches the way the work is actually done.

---

## Project Types – how the system understands what kind of project you are creating

Before a project is created, the system asks a simple but important question.  
“What type of project is this?”

In @@name, this choice is not a formality.  
It determines how the project is structured and how it is used in real work.  
A Project Type describes the nature of the project, such as client implementation, internal initiative, product development, operational work, or something specific to your business.

Based on the selected Project Type, @@name can treat the project differently in practical ways.  
It can focus the project on the information that is relevant for that type of work.  
It can control which Case Categories are allowed in this kind of project.  
It can support a working logic that fits the project, instead of forcing people to adapt to a universal template.

---

## Project Type vs. Project Group – similar concepts, different roles

This is where confusion often arises, so the distinction matters.

Project Type answers the question:  
“What kind of project is this?”  
It defines the identity of the project and the logic that applies to it.

Project Group answers the question:  
“Which projects should share the same structure?”  
It is used when multiple projects need the same Areas and Milestones, without making them global for everyone.

In short, Project Type defines what the project *is*.  
Project Group defines shared structure across multiple projects.

A simple way to choose correctly is this.  
If you want to define the nature of a project, use Project Type.  
If you want multiple projects to share the same Areas and Milestones, use Project Group.

---

## Case Categories – how project type defines the way work is done

Once a project has its type, the next question follows naturally.  
“What kind of work happens inside this project?”

This is where **Case Categories** come into play in @@name.  
Case Categories define the types of work that can exist within a project, and the working logic those tasks carry.  
If Project Type defines what the project is, Case Categories define what kind of work is performed inside it.

---

## From structure to real work

In real life, different projects involve different types of activities.  
A team may do analysis, development, coordination, approvals, client communication, support, or internal improvements.  
When all of these appear as one undifferentiated list of Cases, it becomes harder to understand what the team is actually doing and what capacity is being consumed by which kind of work.

Case Categories allow these activities to be distinguished in a meaningful way.  
Each category can carry its own logic, such as relevant fields, applicable statuses, tracking approach, or working rules.  
As a result, tasks are no longer “just another Case”.  
They become part of a working model that matches the project type and the team’s real process.

---

## How Project Types and Case Categories work together

This is where the connection to Project Types becomes critical.  
Each Project Type can define which Case Categories are allowed and which types of work make sense in that project.

For example, a client implementation project may allow categories such as Analysis, Configuration, and Testing.  
An internal operations project may focus on Requests, Improvements, and Incidents.  
A legal or advisory project may include Consultation, Drafting, and Review.

The outcome is practical and reviewable.  
Teams work with familiar categories that match their reality.  
Projects become easier to understand because work is grouped by meaning, not only by person or date.  
Management gains comparability, because projects of the same type follow a consistent classification of work.

---

## Better project management, stronger focus

Case Categories do not complicate work.  
They focus it.

Instead of all tasks looking the same across all projects, teams can see what kind of work they are doing.  
Managers can see which categories consume capacity and where bottlenecks form.  
Projects become easier to manage and analyze because work is structured before it becomes overload.

Once work is classified clearly, the next question becomes unavoidable.  
“How much work can we realistically handle at the same time?”  
This is where WIP limits create real boundaries that protect flow.

---

## WIP limits – when work flow has real boundaries

In many organizations, “work in progress” grows without control.  
Too many tasks are started, context switching increases, and progress slows down even when people feel busy.

WIP limits address that problem directly in Project Management in @@name.  
They help teams and managers treat work as flow, not as accumulation.

---

## What WIP limits are

WIP (Work In Progress) limits define the maximum number of Cases that can be in a given status or category at the same time.  
This is not a restriction on people.  
It is a restriction on the system, so it reflects real capacity rather than optimistic assumptions.

In practical terms, when a limit is reached, @@name provides a clear signal.  
New work should not flow in automatically.  
The best next action is to finish, unblock, or move existing work forward first.

---

## Why this matters for management

WIP limits protect teams and management from one of the most common traps in project work: assigning more work than can realistically be completed.

With WIP limits, planning becomes more grounded because capacity constraints are explicit.  
Workload becomes visible because “in progress” has a measurable boundary.  
Decisions can be based on capacity signals, not only on urgency or pressure.

Instead of pushing more work into the system, managers can see when the system is already saturated.  
That makes prioritization more honest and coordination more predictable.

---

## Flow, not a task list

WIP limits change how work is perceived.  
The focus shifts from how many tasks exist to how tasks move.

When teams reduce parallel work, flow tends to improve.  
Waiting becomes easier to spot, blocked work becomes harder to ignore, and completion becomes a more consistent outcome.  
The goal is not to “do less”.  
The goal is to start fewer things at once and finish more reliably.

---

## WIP limits as part of the bigger picture

In @@name, WIP limits do not exist in isolation.  
They work together with Project Types, which define context, and Case Categories, which define the types of work.  
They also work together with User States, which show movement and progress in a way that matches the team’s process.

The result is not just stored information.  
It is a working system where structure, classification, and capacity constraints support better day-to-day decisions.

## Why ERP.net

Project Types, Case Categories, and WIP limits in @@name are not “team habits written down”.  
They are explicit configuration elements that make the working model visible and shareable.

This improves explainability because the project context, the type of work, and the flow boundaries are recorded in a consistent way.  
It improves predictability because workflow and capacity constraints are defined through states, categories, and limits, rather than relying on informal expectations.  
And because @@name relies on consistent concepts across the platform, the same classification and flow logic can remain stable as teams grow and projects multiply.

---

## The real value

Project Types, Case Categories, and WIP limits are not a methodology.  
They are practical tools for decision-making.  
They help teams focus on fewer things at a time and finish more consistently.  
They help managers plan without overloading people and without turning status updates into a separate job.

Work does not slow down.  
It simply starts flowing better because the system makes priorities, categories, and capacity constraints visible.

---

## Conclusion

Project Types, Case Categories, and WIP limits work together as a management filter between intention and execution.  
They help define what kind of work is being done, keep work streams clear and comparable, and plan based on real capacity instead of urgency.

Teams understand what they are working on and why.  
Management can see where capacity goes and how work moves.  
This turns Project Management in @@name from a tracking tool into a system that supports better decisions.
