# Assignment Rules & User States  
## When project management becomes a process

In @@name, **Assignment Rules** and **User States** transform work management from simple “organization and assignment” into a sustainable, repeatable process:

- tasks (Cases) reach the right people through clear, predefined rules;
- statuses mean the same thing to everyone — teams, management, and reporting alike.

---

## Why this matters

Even when projects are well structured and tasks are clearly defined, everyday work inevitably raises questions such as:

- Who takes ownership of this task?
- When is a task actually “ready,” and when is it just waiting?
- What does a specific status really mean in practice?
- How do we avoid manual assignment and constant clarifications?

This is where project management moves from a plan to a predictable flow of work.

## Key capabilities

### 1) Assignment Rules — automated work distribution

**Assignment Rules** define how and to whom new or updated Cases are assigned — without the need for manual intervention every time.

Rules can be based on criteria such as:

- project type  
- case category  
- project, project area, or project group  
- other business-specific conditions  

The result is consistent routing of work to:

- the right team,
- the right role,
- or a specific responsible person.

This does not “replace the manager.”  
It removes routine work and reduces the risk of missed tasks — especially in environments with a high volume of incoming work.

**Where it delivers the most value:**

- larger teams with multiple roles  
- repetitive types of work  
- incoming request flows and operational processes  
- service and support models

### 2) User States — a shared language for real progress

Statuses often seem clear… until they mean different things to different people.  
For example, “In progress” might mean:

- active work is happening;
- “we’ll start soon”;
- “we’re waiting for information”.

**User States** solve this by enabling:

- clear, business-meaningful status definitions;
- workflows adapted to how the organization actually works;
- elimination of ambiguity around progress.

User States are not just labels — they are a shared language between teams and management about what is really happening with a task.

## How it works (high level)

### Assignment Rules (high level)

- When a Case is created or when key attributes change (e.g. project, category, area), the system evaluates the applicable rules.
- If a match is found, @@name routes the Case to a team, role, or specific owner based on the rule logic.
- Incoming work is distributed predictably, without bottlenecks caused by manual reassignment or clarification.

### User States (high level)

- User States define the “intermediate” business stages teams actually use (e.g. *Waiting for info*, *For review*, *Ready*).
- This makes progress measurable and comparable — equally understandable to the people doing the work and those monitoring results.

---

## Use cases

These tools are especially valuable for:

- service and support teams  
- organizations with a steady inflow of tasks  
- teams with clearly separated roles and responsibilities  
- companies that want process without micromanagement  
  *(control through rules, not constant manual assignment)*  

Whether for projects, services, or internal coordination, rules and states provide stability at scale and reduce dependency on individual people.

---

## Business benefits

By using Assignment Rules and User States, businesses gain:

- less manual coordination and task routing  
- faster response to new tasks (shorter time to ownership)  
- clearer accountability — who is doing what, and in which real stage  
- reduced operational noise and task “bouncing”  
- a predictable way of working as teams grow and change
