# Presence in @@name

## Overview

People nowadays are always busy with something during their workday. 
Professionals are always shifting between tasks and balancing daily priorities, often handling many things at once.  

Attending meetings, chasing deadlines, being on the go - there are many reasons why team members may be unavailable to respond at the time you seek their attention. 
This makes effective and streamlined communication more essential than ever.  

To help you quickly and easily connect to your team members at the right time for everyone, @@name's web client incorporates the **Presence** functionality.

## What is Presence in @@name

**Presence** is a **real-time status indicator** that displays the current availability of everyone in your team.  

Whether a teammate is actively working, in a meeting, or away from their desk, you can see their status and reach out at the right time. 
The same applies vice versa for your team, letting your colleagues know if it's a good time to connect with you.  

## How Presence in @@name Works

The web platform @@name tracks and shows every team member's availability for communication and collaboration.  

Your teammates' presence (as well as yours) is displayed across chats and social groups within @@name.  

Taking a quick look at it helps you instantly find out if any team member is ready to communicate, too busy at the moment, or simply prefers to avoid distractions and focus on their ongoing tasks.  

@@name shows you to your team (and the other way around) as:  

- **Available**: You’re ready to respond and collaborate.  
- **Busy**: You’re in a meeting or deeply focused on your tasks - you prefer to avoid distractions.  
- **Do not disturb**: You’re either presenting or handling urgent matters – not to be interrupted.  
- **Away**: You've been inactive for more than a few minutes or away from your device.  
- **Offline**: You're not logged in or have been inactive for quite longer.

@@name updates your presence **automatically** based on your activity.  

Manually selecting any state other than **Available** turns off automatic updates to put you in control, letting you manage what availability you want your team to see you in.

> [!Tip]  
> Setting your presence to **Available** resets your status and restores automatic presence updates by the @@name platform.
