# App Bar in @@name Web Client

## A clear starting point for working with applications

In day-to-day work, people constantly switch between functional areas - sales, projects, logistics, and finance. 
What matters is not only *what* they work on, but *how quickly* they can move between contexts without losing focus.  

The **App Bar** in the @@name Web Client is designed to give you a **clear, stable, and fast way to choose the application context you want to work in**, at any moment.

## What the App Bar is

The **App Bar** is the **vertical strip of application icons** on the left side of the @@name Web Client.

It represents the **first level of navigation** in the app-centric navigation model introduced with Web Client v.26. Its role is simple and intentional:

> **The App Bar lets you select the application (context) you want to work in.**

Once an app is selected, **the navigation and available actions are shaped by that context**.

---

## How the App Bar works

### Application-first navigation

Each icon in the App Bar represents an **application or module** available to you - such as Sales, CRM, Projects, or Logistics.

- Selecting an icon switches your working context to that app.
- The navigation and available actions adapt immediately to that context.
- The set of visible apps is **role-based**, so you only see what is relevant and allowed.

This keeps navigation **structured and predictable**, especially in larger systems.

---

### Fast switching with optional hover behavior

The App Bar supports an optional **hover-to-open** interaction:

- Hovering over an app icon opens the app’s navigation instantly.
- You can preview or move into another app without interrupting your current task flow.

This reduces unnecessary clicks and supports quick orientation.

---

### Pinning and navigation comfort (space vs. guidance)

The App Bar lets you adjust how persistent and how compact the left-side navigation should be, depending on your screen size and working style.

- You can **pin or unpin** the App Bar (and the App-Centric Navigation panel).
- You can **show or hide application labels** to switch between:
  - Icon-only mode for compact layouts
  - Icon + label mode for easier orientation
- You can **show or hide the breadcrumb trail** to balance:
  - Quick orientation and one-tap navigation
  - A cleaner, more compact working space
- You can switch between **Standard view** and **Advanced view**:
  - Standard view supports focused, straightforward daily work
  - Advanced view supports deeper customization of panels, navigators, and record forms

These options let you balance **screen space**, **guidance**, and **navigation stability** without changing the underlying navigation model.

### Role-based visibility with user personalization

The App Bar combines governance with flexibility:

- **Roles determine which apps appear**.
- **Users control how the App Bar behaves** (pinning, labels, and layout).

This ensures consistency across teams while still supporting individual productivity.

---

### Home, App Launcher, and navigation anchors

The App Bar includes consistent navigation anchors:

- The **App Launcher (Grid Menu) button** opens or closes the **Global Menu** with all available applications and shows or hides the App Bar when it is unpinned.
- The **Home icon**, available from the **breadcrumb menu**, returns you to the **first application** set in your App Bar order.

These elements provide a reliable way to re-orient, even after deeper navigation.

---

### App-level activity awareness

The App Bar can display **notification badges per application**, indicating that something new has happened in a specific app.

**In addition to the global notifications in @@name**, you can immediately see **where attention is needed**, helping you react faster in the right functional area.

---

## Why the App Bar matters for your business

**Faster navigation, fewer interruptions**
- Switching between applications takes **fractions of a second**.
- Moving between functional areas involves **less navigation overhead**.
- Hover and pinning behavior reduce friction during daily work.

**Clear working context and orientation across business areas**
- Users always know **which business area they are working in**.
- The active application provides a **clear contextual anchor**.
- This reduces cross-module mistakes and hesitation.

**Consistent adoption across roles and teams**
- Users learn the system **app by app**.
- New teammates onboard faster and collaborate more easily.
- Navigation reflects **business structure**, not technical menus.
- Teams get used to the **same navigation model and logic** across applications.

**Personal productivity without breaking structure**
- Layout adapts to individual preferences, **boosting personal productivity**.
- The underlying navigation remains **consistent and role-governed**.

**More actionable awareness**
- App-level badges guide attention to the **functional area they belong to**.

## Practical use in everyday business workflows

In real business operations, the App Bar acts as a **shared navigation map** across teams, making cross-functional work easier and more predictable.

**Sales teams**
- Stay anchored in customer-related work.
- Switch quickly to adjacent applications when coordination is needed.
- Check availability, delivery status, or related projects without losing context.

**Operations and logistics teams**
- Keep execution-focused navigation during daily work.
- Shift context instantly to review upstream inputs or downstream impact.
- Validate sales commitments, fulfillment dependencies, or exceptions without changing navigation patterns.

**Managers and coordinators**
- Move smoothly between applications to review progress, approvals, and exceptions.
- Use the same navigation model across all functional areas.
- Reduce friction caused by different menus or navigation paths.

This consistency supports smoother collaboration, even when work spans multiple applications and teams.

## Putting it into context

The **App Bar** is the Web Client’s **application-level anchor**. It keeps navigation organized by **business context**, enables fast switching between functional areas, and improves awareness of activity at the application level.

Once the desired context is chosen, a **second navigation layer** helps you move *within* the application - providing concrete entry points for selecting the entities, views, actions, and notifications relevant to that area.

That next layer is the **App-Centric Navigation Panel**, which is described in the next article in this section.
