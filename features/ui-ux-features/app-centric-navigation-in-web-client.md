# App-Centric Navigation in @@name Web Client

## Working into complex business areas

In modern ERP systems, switching between business areas is only half of the challenge.  
The other half is staying oriented **once you are inside an application** - knowing where to go next, what is available, and what matters right now.

@@name’s Web Client addresses this with an **app-centric navigation model**.  
After an application is selected (via the App Bar), a second navigation layer helps you move **within that application** in a structured, predictable way.

This second layer is the **App-Centric Navigation Panel**.

## What the App-Centric Navigation Panel is

The **App-Centric Navigation Panel** is the **left-side navigation panel** that appears next to the App Bar and changes with the selected application.

It represents the **“inside the app” navigation layer**:

- The App Bar helps you choose *which application* you want to work in  
- The App-Centric Navigation Panel helps you move *within that application*

Each application defines its own navigation structure, so the panel always reflects the **business area you are currently working in**.

---

## Navigation shaped by application context

Once an application is active, the navigation adapts to that context:

- It shows the **entities, operations, reports, and supporting areas** relevant to the selected application  
- Sections are grouped by purpose, such as **Documents & Operations** and **Reports & Ledgers**  
- The current selection is highlighted, helping you stay oriented as you move  

This keeps navigation **focused and meaningful**, even in applications with many entities and workflows.

---

## Navigation stays left, work stays central

The Web Client layout deliberately separates **navigation** from **working space**:

- Navigation lives on the left, in the App-Centric Navigation Panel  
- Work happens in the central area, where lists, records, and reports open  

This separation allows you to move between lists, operations, and reports without losing visual stability or focus on your current task.

## Faster access to what you use most

For the variety of applications, the navigation panel provides several **speed surfaces** that support daily work:

- **Favorites** for quick access to frequently used objects  
- **Recently viewed** entries to return to recent work  
- **Pinned items** for ongoing or important items  

These items may include **customers**, **projects**, **documents**, **tasks**, or other types of resources, depending on the application you are working in.

The adaptive speed surfaces also act as **entry and return points**, improving personal productivity while keeping the overall navigation structure consistent across teams.

## Creating records directly from navigation

The navigation panel also supports **quick creation**:

- A **“+” button** next to navigation items allows you to create new records directly  
- This mirrors the familiar “+ New” behavior found in navigators  

It shortens the path from intent to action, especially when working repeatedly into the same business area.

---

## App-scoped notifications into navigation

Each application can expose a **Notifications section** directly in its navigation panel:

- Unread notifications are grouped by application  
- Badge counts align with global and per-app notification indicators  

This keeps attention focused on **what requires action in the current business area**, without forcing you to leave context.

---

## Role-based visibility with personal speed

The App-Centric Navigation Panel balances governance and flexibility:

- **Roles** determine which entities and sections are visible inside an application  
- **Users** benefit from personal speed through favorites, recents, and pinned items  

The result is a navigation model that reflects business responsibilities, while still supporting individual working styles.

---

## Standalone apps with specialized navigation

Some applications in @@name are designed as focused standalone experiences and use their own internal navigation patterns.

- Apps such as **Calendar**, **To Do**, **Groups**, **Tiles**, and **Favorites** manage navigation primarily through in-app controls like views, toolbars, tabs, panels, and lists  
- Navigation is handled directly within the application interface and adapts to the specific purpose of the app  

They are accessed through the same application-first experience, while allowing navigation to adapt to the nature of each app.

## Why it matters in daily work

### Clear orientation inside each application
- You always know which business area you are working in  
- Navigation reflects the active application, reducing confusion  

### Faster execution with fewer interruptions
- Quick access to entities, reports, and operations  
- Shorter paths between common actions  

### Personal productivity without breaking structure
- Speed surfaces adapt to individual habits  
- The underlying navigation remains consistent and role-governed  

### More actionable awareness
- Notifications appear where work is actually done  
- Attention stays aligned with the current application

## Putting it into context

@@name uses two complementary navigation layers:

- The **App Bar** helps you select the application you want to work in  
- The **App-Centric Navigation Panel** helps you move within that application  

Together, they create a navigation experience that stays **business-oriented, predictable, and scalable**, no matter how many applications or workflows your organization uses.
