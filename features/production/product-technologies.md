# Product technologies overview

Module Product technologies is the core of the manufacturing part of @@name. In it, you can set a **Principal technology** to each product group, on the base of which you can specify a certain formulation for the production of a given product. This technology includes the bill of materials for the manufacturing of a product, including:

* **materials and raw materials** used in manufacturing – the necessary amounts of each ingredient
* **operations and phases** the manufacturing process needs to go through
* **production activities** in the base of determining standard times, resource capacity (load) and costs
* **involved resources** (machines and people) that are necessary to carry out the manufacturing process

The manufacturing technology of a product is defined as a detailed sequence of manufacturing operations and phases (technological route). When creating a technological route, each operation is assigned a main resource (work center) where it is performed, as well as specific duration and other parameters that define the production process in detail. Each operation is associated with the relevant, to-be-processed materials (components) of the final product, as well as the production resources and tools used in the operation. On the back of this information, the system facilitates planning of the production process. It can automatically suggest a plan that takes into account the necessary materials.

The created technology serves as a template of materials in production reporting. In @@name, technology can be dynamically adjusted – when it is necessary to change interchangeable raw materials or products, as well as in case of changes in the amounts of utilized raw materials.
