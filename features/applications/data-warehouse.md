#   ERP.net Data warehouse module – the information and reporting powerhouse of your organization
In the information-dominated business landscape, making use and making sense of accumulated data is becoming core to gaining knowledge and making informed decisions. Organizations are collecting and amassing so much data that storing and processing it becomes a significant challenge, especially within the ERP system they are working with. Even nowadays it is still a common practice for companies to create numerous Excel tables to handle these vast amounts of data. While Excel tables are great for organizing and sorting data sets and applying basic calculations and formulas, when it comes to storing, controling, and analyzing data from different sources to support business intelligence, mere tables will not make it. Even a simple everyday example, such as having multiple versions of the same file, each with different values, or accidentally deleting crucial file information can help highlight the need for a more sophisticated method of handling and utilizing company data.

Enter the ERP.net *Data warehouse* module – the digital storage of all your organization’s information – collected, connected, and harmonized from a number of disparate sources, systems, databases, or even companies. This central repository stores integrated data – both current and historical – and is the key ingredient for business analysis, reporting, and insight. With the *Data warehouse*, data from heterogenous and external sources is properly formatted and stored, so that queries and analysis can be easily performed by any BI system to get a current and long-range view of data over time. Business analysts use such information as the basis of balance scorecards, to cut data into dimensions, measure performance over time, benchmark and compare target values and key parameters and even combine data from a number of ERP systems and visualize reports within the built-in BI panels of ERP.net navigators.

Apart from helping analysts make sense of accrued financial, accounting, and performance data, the *Data warehouse* module helps teams enter and operate with everyday data more easily and get a more profound overview of data within their workflows. For example, team members can enter information about sales within a specific time period, even for periods before you implemented the ERP system, or commonplace information, such as visits of sales associates with prospects. All audit records are stored within the module and access is restricted only to users with the proper rights granted. Version history of all entries is accessible and available in the Data Tracking module of ERP.net. As with the rest of the ERP.net system, you can easily customize and add new fields to the list of predefined ones, based on your specific needs or scenario.

Information input need not be a nuisance – with the *Data warehouse* module you can simply copy and paste data in the navigator – in the same field sequence as in your Excel table. You can then grant different levels of access rights to stakeholders, edit or update field data, and define which fields need to keep their historical versions.

What’s more – your team will appreciate the chat functionality that helps colleagues be in sync and discuss real-time what information needs an update, debate over field values, or analyze sales data on the go. Apart from being a collaboration tool, you can also use the chat as a simple project management tool to assign tasks to team members, send notifications, and track task execution.

Summing it up – in addition to being the data powerhouse of your business, the *Data warehouse* module helps teams conduct complex data operations in a simple, yet effective manner. Managers can make data-driven decisions based on financial and operating reporting grounded on data from different sources and systems that is stored and analyzed within the ERP.net platform and its native BI functionality. You can also integrate and utilize external applications for analysis and reporting, such as Power BI.

With the *Data warehouse* module, you can:
* Store large amounts of current and historic data within your ERP.net system
* Collect and format data from disparate systems and sources
* Make queries and use data as basis for BI analysis and reporting
* Devise balance scorecards to compare and analyze target values, parameters, and performance over time
