# To Do Feature

## Overview

Common chores and daily duties are a part of our everyday life - at and outside of work. 
No matter what your engagements and activities are or what responsibilities you carry, you will repeatedly come across a number of **small tasks** every day. 
These tasks are called **To Do tasks**.  

**To Dos** usually involve **taking quick actions** to **accomplish simple goals**. 
They are too small, plain, or just generally standalone to exist as a part of a project. 
Therefore, such tasks are often arranged in lists, known as **To Do Lists**, to facilitate **categorizing** and **navigating** through them.  

To Do tasks are everywhere around us. 
This makes it very easy to provide so many examples:  

* **Communicational to-dos** - "Call Janine today", "Notify the team of the new changes tomorrow", "Ask Pete for help about...", etc. 
* **Quick-action to-dos** - "Update the blogpost on...", "Review the new safety procedure", "Issue an invoice for customer...", and more. 
* **Organizational and support to-dos** - "Book an HVAC service appointment", "Schedule a meeting for...", "Order new cleaning detergents", and so on.  

To Do tasks are meant to be relatively **fast and easy** to get done. 
They serve as **itemized reminders** for you to take care of some little issues, run some errands, or fulfill some promises made.  

Continuously covering nothing less than everything in your business processes, **@@name** unveils its brand-new feature for lightning-fast handling of these tasks: **To Do**.

## Opportunities To Do Offers You

Sometimes, a small or insignificant problem can slip out of your workflows and cause some trouble later. 
Not with **To Do**, though, as @@name's new feature **targets exactly those issues and small tasks** to be **noticed and addressed properly and timely**.  

**To Do** excels in **speed** and **simplicity**. 
The new feature provides a quick and simple way to **write down**, **track**, and **mark** pending duties and chores as completed within the business management platform. 

**To Do** tasks are designed to be **created within seconds** by just **typing in a title**. 
They are intended to be personal, and as such, can be assigned to you or other staff members.  

When opened afterwards, the task is shown in a **consistent** and **easy to navigate form** displaying more properties, such as the due date, time of reminding, assigned to user, level of importance, and other fields.

## Take Advantage of @@name's To Do Feature

**To Do**s substitute sticky notes and paper notepads. 
This enables your office to **deal away** with having to sort and store pieces of paper until completion and discard them afterwards.  

The new feature **fully utilizes the features native for digital**, and especially, **mobile devices**:  

* **24/7 Availability** - tasks are constantly available on any device - convenient when you are working remotely or are on business trips. 
* **Reminders** - offering the option to set times for pushing a reminder to your system, ensuring you won't forget a duty. 
* **Unlimited number** - you can have a practically unlimited number of tasks since they occupy negligible amounts of virtual space. 
* **Clarity** - edit tasks as many times as you want without leaving scratched-out or scribbled-over outdated and wrong details. 
* **Cost-effective and ecological** - reducing expenditures for stationery, as well as offering a more ecological work model. 
* **Professional look** - your workplace is much tidier and cleaner, sending the message about a well-organized work approach.  


With **To Do**, @@name brings a new feature to make you and your team's workplaces **much tidier and cleaner**. 
Taking advantage of it, your office leaves in the past having pieces of paper scattered through or hanging out, cluttering desks and computers. 
This eliminates turmoil and ink stains, giving a much more **professional and cozy work setting**. 
A tidy and organized environment is especially important when welcoming and meeting your customers, partners, and stakeholders in the office or elsewhere.  

**To Do**s in @@name also give you an edge comapred to using external third-party to-do apps by making use of the platform's extensive capabilities:  

* **Simplicity**:  
The moment you give a name to a task is the moment it can be created. 
A title is the single one requirement for creating a new To Do task. 
All other fields, offering much more details, are optional.  

* **Integration**:  
Using to dos internally in @@name means you benefit from the well-known general features in the system. 
You can use already existing object records to autofill the fields, such as contacts, companies, and parties for assignments and target subjects. 
As can be expected from @@name, To Do features chats and files for each task.  

* **Visibility and navigation-friendly**:  
Your To Dos are itemized and structured by Social Groups, fine-ordered by their current progress status. 
The most important attributes are visible under the task name right on the tasks listing.
Tasks can be followed by you or other members of the Social Group, getting notified of any changes done by anyone.  

* **Available on the web**:  
Tasks are always created, edited, and saved directly in your @@name's cloud storage. 
This brings to your company the inherent benefits of cloud-hosted software. 
First, you avoid the risk of losing information, failed synchronizations, or losing data due to broken or lost devices.  
And second, everyone in your team can access their tasks using any mobile device, anywhere.  

* **Teamwork support**:  
To Dos are personal tasks that are compatible with teamwork-oriented approach. 
You can place a task to be visible in a Social Group or pull it to your personal list. 
By publishing a task in a Social Group you let all members of this group follow through its information and progress. 
Moving tasks from one Social Group to another is as simple as changing the assigned Social Group.  

* **Cost-effective**:  
Leveraging this feature of @@name helps you sum up and arrange your work within the interface of the system.  
Thus, your company can get free from juggling multiple external non-integrable apps. 
Next to being practical, it is cost-reducing too, as your business enjoys complete functionality without needing to pay for countless apps and subscriptions.  

> [!NOTE]
> **To Do** is **available in all subscription plans** of @@name.  
> The feature **remains always available to your business** regardless of the plan you initially choose or later switch to.  

## The Bottom Line 

**To Do** solves problems that are hard or inappropriate to be tracked, addressed, or accounted for elsewhere. 
The feature provides all means to distinguish small tasks and quick actions from the general work with primary documentation and object records in the system while still providing **@@name's native connectivity all between**.  

Small tasks get done easily using **fast and simple tools**. 
And **To Do** brings to you **precisely these tools**.
