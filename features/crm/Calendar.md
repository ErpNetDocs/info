## Overview

Calendars are well-known and widespread tools used for event management purposes. **@@name Calendar** is a valuable tool that empowers **coordinated planning, execution, and tracking** of personal and team assignments, as well as holding meetings related to **decision-making, project management, and other activities**.

## User-Friendly Interface

@@name Calendar's visual design incorporates a **user-friendly interface** that helps you quickly and easily **navigate, view, and manage your business's appointments** throughout the full set of events. 

You can see **all appointments** in one place for a more general view of your company's engagements and commitments.

Using **filtering** you can select the **filters** you need and assign the **desired values** to them. 
You can also set various **combinations** comprised from as many filters as desired.  

This way the Calendar of @@name will show you **only the appointments that match your filtering**, no matter the complexity of combinations you wish to set for your filtering.  

## Multiple legal entities in your @@name Calendar

@@name Calendar also grants you opportunities for **centralized event and human workload management** when your business has **more than one legal entity** registered and operates these entities **separately from a legal perspective**.  

The Calendar of @@name **stores, manages, and shares** **real-time event information** with all of your enterprises and parties within a common business structure or business franchise.  

## What This Means for You

You can **create, edit, visualize, and work** on common appointments, even when your arrangements concern **participants taking roles in separate legal entities** that are part of holdings and vast corporate business structures spanning **multiple geographical locations and international markets**. 
This also applies to assigning tasks and meetings to people working in **different departments and legal entities** in your business structure.
