# Marketing

The marketing module is used to manage the marketing processes.


## Marketing Activities

The Marketing activities functionality allows you to improve tracking and monitoring of the activities, performed by your marketing team. The system can help you keep track of responsibility and deadlines. When defining marketing activities, you can choose from the following types:

* Communication
* Meeting
* Task


## Marketing Campaigns

Marketing campaigns are organized, strategic efforts to achieve a specific company goal. The Marketing campaigns functionality can include a number of different marketing activities. You can easily track the costs for each campaign activity and for the whole marketing campaign. Moreover, if you fill in the marketing campaign field in the sales orders, you can track the revenue from the specific campaign. 


## Distribution Channel

A distribution channel is a chain of businesses through which goods or services pass until it reaches the end customer. Distribution channels can include wholesalers, retailers, distributors, etc. You can use distribution channels when setting up sales prices, sales discounts, bonus programs and promotional packages. 


## Forecast Items

You can use Forecasts Items to plan future product sales. They are especially useful when you are planning to launch a new product, so the system cannot plan its sales and production. You can also use this functionality for products whose delivery time is much longer than the shipping time to the end customer.
