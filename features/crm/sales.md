To keep customers satisfied, you must meet many requirements. An immediate and accurate response to inquiries, such as questions about the delivery time or the price, is a key factor to customer satisfaction. Also, efficiently handling special customer requests is important to ensure further orders. Typical examples of those requests include:

* Partial shipments or shipments to different addresses
* Receiving the orders before they are invoiced
* Combined invoicing for several shipment orders 

You must also ensure that you can register sales information easily in the ERP system.
