# Client Center

Client Center is a functionality, which allows the clients to access their data and communicate with you online.

## Data

The data section allows the clients to:

* View orders
* View and download invoices
* View unpaid orders/invoices

# Chat

The chat allows the clients to communicate with you in very direct and friendly way.
It is heavily inspired by the social networks, but in an enterprise environment.

For more information, see the [Chatter component](xref:chatter).
