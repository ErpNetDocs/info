# Client Center -  a single platform to engage with customers

Increase collaboration and exchange rich information between employees, suppliers, and customers. Eliminate data redundancy and errors by working with accurate, real-time data about invoices, orders and their status anytime, anywhere. 

Client Center is a functionality which allows the clients to access their documents and communicate with you online.

## Documents and downloads

The documents section allows the clients to quickly access their data and reduce the workload on your support team. Clients can:

* View old orders and cancel orders in status "new"
* View and download invoices
* View unpaid orders/invoices and their status

## New Orders

Automate new orders placement with the Client Center orders. Your customers can make orders directly from Client Center, increasing sales. 

# Chat

The chat allows your customers to communicate with you in a very direct and friendly way.
Inspired heavily by social networks, it is integrated into the platform to be utilized in an enterprise environment.
The chat is a powerful and convenient tool which helps you keep a timely comunication with customers a click away.
