# Distribution

The Distribution module is used to manage the salesperson targets.


## Salesperson Targets

Specific and realistic sales targets will help your sales team perform confidently, consistently and with a clear understanding of your expectations. Choosing the right type of targets can help you achieve your sales goals and grow your profits. You can use the following target types:

## Salesperson Target Fulfillment

It is important to stay on top of your numbers and always be aware about how close you are to hitting your sales targets. To do this you can use the Salesperson Target Fulfillment report. It shows combined information about the goals and up-to-date sales.
