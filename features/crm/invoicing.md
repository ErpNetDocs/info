# Invoicing

The invoicing module is used to manage the invoice process.


## Invoice Order

> *Activity* → *Opportunity* → *Offer* → *Sales Order* → **Invoice Order** → *Invoice*

The invoicing order is an intermediate document between the Sales Order and the Invoice. It indicates to the system that an invoice must be created. Using the Invoice Order allows you to have multiple sales grouped into one invoice or split one sale into multiple invoices.


## Invoice

An invoice is a time-stamped commercial document that itemizes and records a transaction between a buyer and a seller. You can set different document types:
* Invoice
* Debit note
* Credit note

You can create an Invoice from an Invoicing Order document or through the Invoicing Navigator. The Invoicing Navigator allows you to split or combine sales when creating invoices.
