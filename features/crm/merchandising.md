# Merchandising

The Merchandising subsystem in @@name is used to plan and track activities with customers. 

## Plan merchandising activities

Prepare for various in store activities and plan specific tasks like:
* Promotions
* Inventory count
* Product sampling
* Stock restructuring

## Track in store tasks progress

When in store, merchandisers track preplaned activities by:
* Log in store visits and add pictures of copleted tasks directly from mobile devices
* Add documents and files to specific activity 
* Keep track of infomation about competitors, in store prices and existing store availability
* Easily look at prevoius activities and uploaded files 

## New orders with Vendor Managed Inventory

The main process in the VMI subsystem is:
> *Plan marketing activities* → *Enter store availability* → *@@name suggest new order* → *New Sales Order*

When the merchandisers perform a invetory check and record the existing store availability, @@name will automatically suggest new order quantity based on customer's settings.
@@name looks into the minimum and maximum quantity for the specific product and customer and suggest a new order quantity. 
This ensurers that stores will keep selling our products without delivery delays.
