# Bonus Programs

In theory, having a sale is easy enough: Take a service or a product, offer a discount, get new customers, bring in more money. But in practice, sales promotions involve a high level of strategy. Before announcing a sale, you need to consider what type of promotion to offer and when to run it. Should the offer be a discount or a free gift with the purchase? What are the goals of the sale: attracting new customers, introducing new products, moving old inventory?

Here are some examples that can help you decide if @@name is the right solution for your business.
