# End Customer

Sometimes, businesses sell to an intermediary partner, who sells to a non-anonymous end customer.
For example, selling software licenses is frequently transacted this way.

> The important part is that the seller knows the end customer and wants to track it for each sale.

This is when this feature comes handy.
It is integrated with [Order Management](order-management.md), @reporting and @bi.
