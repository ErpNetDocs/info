# To Do Application

## Overview

No matter what we do, we repeatedly come across a **number of small tasks** every day. 
These quick jobs usually **appear spontaneously** and tend to **gradually stack up**. 
With so many important activities it is easy to forget some routine duties to the side. 

Well-built work processes rely on more persistent and dependable tools than human memory. 
For that, **@@name** adds a brand-new application to its integrated app suite: **To Do**.  

The new **To Do** is a **personal reminder tool**. 
Its purpose is to remind you to tend to some issues or pending jobs later. 
In this manner, it lets you focus on **the more productive aspects** of the business.
