# To Do Feature

## Overview

No matter what you engage in or what responsibilities you carry, we repeatedly come across a **number of small tasks** every day. 
These jobs usually **appear spontaneously** and tend to **gradually stack over** the course of work. 
With so many important activities we get involved, it is easy to forget some routine duties to the side. 
Nevertheless, this doesn't make it less necessary to get them done.  

Well-built work processes rely on tools that are more persistent and dependable than human memory. 
For that, **@@name** adds a brand-new app to its integrated app suite: **To Do**.  

The new **To Do** is a **personal reminder tool**. 
Its purpose is to remind you to tend to some issues or pending jobs later.
By this it liberates your mind to focus on **the more productive aspects** of the business.

**To Do** reminders are designed to be **created within seconds** by just **typing in a title**.  

## Implementation of To Do in @name

The **To Do app** is designed to support you in your ordinary daily work. 
It acts as a list of itemized reminders for you and everyone else in your teams. 
**To Dos** remind you to **take care of some little issues**, **run some errands**, or **fulfill some promises made**.  

> [!NOTE]  
> **To Dos** are meant to be **simple** and **easily readable reminders**.  
> The **full set of information** necessary for the job is usually **stored elsewhere**.  
> Other apps and functionalities of the system are used for **task management and project management**.  

**To Do reminders** usually involve **taking quick actions** to **accomplish simple goals**, such as:  

* "Call Janine today" 
* "Review the new safety procedure" 
* "Schedule a meeting for the team"  

and so on.  

@@name enables you to **assign To Dos to yourself** or **anyone else in your group** responsible for the job.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To Dos are usually given just some hints and small pieces of data to remind you of a pending duty.  
> As they function **as a neat personal reminder**, they are usually **kept assigned to their owner**.  

## Opportunities To Do Offers You

Sometimes, a small or insignificant problem can slip out of your workflows and cause some trouble later. 
@@name's new feature **targets exactly those issues and small tasks** to be **noticed and addressed properly and timely**.  

**To Do** excels in **speed** and **simplicity**. 
The new feature provides a quick and simple way to **write down**, **track**, and **mark** pending duties and chores as completed within the business management platform.  

When opened afterwards, the reminder is shown in a **consistent** and **easy to navigate form** displaying more properties, such as the due date, time of reminding, assigned to user, level of importance, and other fields.

Checking a to do as completed, as expected, is **a single-tap action**.  

## Take Advantage of @@name's To Do Feature

**To Do**s substitute sticky notes and paper notepads. 
This enables your office to **deal away** with having to sort and store pieces of paper until completion and discard them afterwards.  

The new app makes use of the platform's extensive capabilities:  

* **Simplicity** - a title is the single one requirement for creating a new To Do task. 
* **Integration** - You can use autofill with already existing object records, as well as chats and files attached to each reminder. 
* **Visibility** - the most important attributes are visible under the reminder's name right on the To Do list.
*  **Navigation-friendly** - your reminders are structured by Social Groups and current progress status.
* **Available on the web**: reminders are saved directly in your @@name's cloud storage, remaining always at hand. 
* **Teamwork support** - you can place and move To Dos in Social Groups to let all group members follow through the progress. 
* **Cost-effective** - your business enjoys complete functionality without needing to pay for countless apps and subscriptions.  




Leveraging this feature of @@name helps you sum up and arrange your work within the interface of the system.  
Thus, your company can get free from juggling multiple external non-integrable apps. 
Next to being practical, it is cost-reducing too, as

> **To Do** is **available in all subscription plans** of @@name.  
> The feature **remains always available to your business** regardless of the plan you initially choose or later switch to.  

## The Bottom Line 

**To Do** solves problems that are hard or inappropriate to be tracked, addressed, or accounted for elsewhere. 
The feature provides all means to distinguish small tasks and quick actions from the general work with primary documentation and object records in the system while still providing **@@name's native connectivity all between**.  

Small tasks get done easily using **fast and simple tools**.
