# To Do Feature

## Overview

No matter what you engage in or what responsibilities you carry, we repeatedly come across a **number of small tasks** every day. 
These jobs usually **appear spontaneously** and tend to **gradually stack over** the course of work. 
With so many important activities we get involved, it is easy to forget some routine duties to the side. 
Nevertheless, this doesn't make it less necessary to get them done.  

Well-built work processes rely on tools that are more persistent and dependable than human memory. 
For that, **@@name** adds a brand-new app to its integrated app suite: **To Do**.  

The new **To Do** is a **personal reminder tool**. 
Its purpose is to remind you to tend to some issues or pending jobs later.
By this it liberates your mind to focus on **the more productive aspects** of the business.

**To Do** reminders are designed to be **created within seconds** by just **typing in a title**.  

## Implementation of To Do in @name

The **To Do app** is designed to support you in your ordinary daily work. 
It acts as a list of itemized reminders for you and everyone else in your teams. 
**To Dos** remind you to **take care of some little issues**, **run some errands**, or **fulfill some promises made**.  

> [!NOTE]  
> **To Dos** are meant to be **simple** and **easily readable reminders**.  
> The **full set of information** necessary for the job is usually **stored elsewhere**.  
> Other apps and functionalities of the system are used for **task management and project management**.  

**To Do reminders** usually involve **taking quick actions** to **accomplish simple goals**, such as:  

* "Call Janine today" 
* "Review the new safety procedure" 
* "Schedule a meeting for the team"  

and so on.  

@@name enables you to **assign To Dos to yourself** or **anyone else in your group** responsible for the job.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To Dos are usually given just some hints and small pieces of data to remind you of a pending duty.  
> As they function **as a neat personal reminder**, they are usually **kept assigned to their owner**.

This eliminates turmoil and ink stains, giving a much more **professional and cozy work setting**. 
A tidy and organized environment is especially important when welcoming and meeting your customers, partners, and stakeholders in the office or elsewhere.  

**To Do**s in @@name also give you an edge comapred to using external third-party to-do apps by making use of the platform's extensive capabilities:

A title is the single one requirement for creating a new To Do task. 
All other fields, offering much more details, are optional.

Using to dos internally in @@name means you benefit from the well-known general features in the system.

As can be expected from @@name, To Do features chats and files for each task.  

* **Visibility and navigation-friendly**:  
Your To Dos are itemized and structured by Social Groups, fine-ordered by their current progress status. 
The most important attributes are visible under the task name right on the tasks listing.
Tasks can be followed by you or other members of the Social Group, getting notified of any changes done by anyone.  

* **Available on the web**:  
Tasks are always created, edited, and saved directly in your @@name's cloud storage. 
This brings to your company the inherent benefits of cloud-hosted software. 
First, you avoid the risk of losing information, failed synchronizations, or losing data due to broken or lost devices.  
And second, everyone in your team can access their tasks using any mobile device, anywhere.  

* **Teamwork support**:  
To Dos are personal tasks that are compatible with teamwork-oriented approach. 
You can place a task to be visible in a Social Group or pull it to your personal list.
