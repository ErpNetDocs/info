# Payment Reminders

Developer: [Smart Business Soft](https://smartbsoft.com/)

The Payment Reminders is a solution that fully automatically sends emails to customers for their overdue payments and it is fully integrated with business software ERP.net.

## The main problems that functionality solves:

* Limiting the human factor and excluding technical errors. Such mistakes lead to additional lost time in communication and discussion of the mistake.
* Avoiding dependence on the current commitment of the team. With a momentary load, it is possible for the task to be delayed or missed, which would lead to a delay in the collection of debts.
* Reducing the daily commitments of the team. This allows the team to focus on other tasks that are important to your organization.
* Faster collection of receivables from customers.

## The application allows:

* To specify the clients to which you wish to be sent a reminder.
* You can send more than one email to a specific customer.
* Select the period at which emails are sent automatically:
  * Daily (every day - choose the time in which to send emails)
  * Weekly (every week - choose the day and time in which to send emails)
  * Monthly (every month - choose the date of the month and time to send emails)
  * Annually (every year - choose the date of the year and time to send emails)
* Select a send option:
  * Once
  * Until the payment of the debt
* Select your email from which to send Reminder Letters.
* Select your email to receive a Report on sent emails:

## How it works

Each customer receives an email with a list of overdue invoices (number, date, due date, overdue, total amount, remaining amount, currency).

The application returns the following feedback to the sending stratum:
* Successfully sent emails by customers, numbers of overdue invoices, amounts and to which emails they are sent
* Unsuccessful letters sent to customers and the reason for this
