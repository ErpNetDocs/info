Nowadays, modern manufacturing enterprises need something more than a standard ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. Companies need a flexible business solution that can support an agile and lean supply chain and maintain versatile production capacity. A solution that will increase their ability to respond quickly to fluctuations in demand volume and improve productivity and profitability. The ERP solution ought to be mobile, available via the web and on different kinds of mobile devices, and completely integrated with the communications system of the company. It should also be reliable, secure and capable of managing a network of geographically separated production facilities and trade offices. In addition, the ERP system must also have powerful business intelligence functionalities enabling real-time visibility into manufacturing operations data.
